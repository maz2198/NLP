       "      <td>Up to 9.5 million women and girls could miss out on vital family planning services this year because of Covid-19, potentially resulting in thousands of deaths. Marie Stopes International warned on Friday that travel restrictions and lockdowns could have a devastating affect on women as they struggle to collect contraceptives and access other reproductive healthcare services, such as safe abortions, across the 37 countries in which it works. MSI estimates that with an 80% reduction in service delivery for three months, and minimal services for the remainder of the year, 9.5 million people will miss out. If things were to return to normal after three months of disruption, the figure would drop to 4 million. The organisation predicts that the loss of services could result in as many as 3 million additional unintended pregnancies, 2.7 million unsafe abortions and 11,00 pregnancy-related deaths. Last year, 32 million women used contraceptives provided by MSI, which is now calling on governments around the world to include reproductive healthcare on its list of essential services. Marie Stopes UK said it was open for business as usual. Simon Cooke, MSI’s chief executive, said: “Women and girls will pay the price if governments do not act now to safeguard access to essential healthcare, including safe abortion and contraception.” In Nepal, the start of a national lockdown on 24 March immediately forced the closure of Marie Stopes clinics across the country. The government has now issued passes allowing health workers to travel to the clinics and some are beginning to reopen. Marie Stopes Nepal reported an increased number of calls from women wanting abortion services since the start of the lockdown. In Sierra Leone, Felix Ikenna, a doctor and quality assurance director for MSI, pointed to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 as evidence of the importance of providing reproductive healthcare services. Researchers found that the closure of clinics and reduced reproductive healthcare services led to between 3,600 and 4,900 additional maternal, neonatal and stillbirth deaths between 2014 and 2015, compared with 4,00 deaths from the Ebola virus itself during the entire epidemic. “People will always need services, irrespective of an epidemic,” said Ikenna. “During Ebola, the number of women we saw went up as word spread that we were still open. “The crisis led to a spike in the number of teenage pregnancies. People were too afraid to go to hospital or government facilities. If we had stopped providing contraception and post-abortion care, it would have been much worse.” A briefing paper, published by the UN population fund last month, warned that the availability and distribution of contraceptives and other maternal health medicines were already being hampered by the pandemic. “This could have life-threatening consequences and reverse recent gains to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health,” it said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>At least 16 suspected domestic abuse killings in the UK have been identified by campaigners since the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed, far higher than the average rate for the time of year, it has emerged. Karen Ingala Smith, the founder of Counting Dead Women, a pioneering project that records the killing of women by men in the UK, has identified at least 16 killings between 23 March and 12 April, including those of children. Looking at the same period over the last 10 years, Smith’s data records an average of five deaths. Her findings for 2020, which are collated from internet searches and people contacting over social media, were raised during evidence to the home affairs select ommittee on Wednesday. Dame Vera Baird QC, the victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, told MPs at the remote session: “Counting Dead Women has got to a total of 16 domestic abuse killings in the last three weeks. We usually say there are two a week, that looks to me like five a week, that’s the size of this crisis.” A number of domestic abuse charities and campaigners have reported a surge in calls to helplines and online services since the lockdown conditions were imposed, reflecting experiences in other countries. Smith, who is also chief executive of a domestic abuse charity, said: “I don’t believe coronavirus creates violent men. What we’re seeing is a window into the levels of abuse that women live with all the time. Coronavirus may exacerbate triggers, though I might prefer to call them excuses. Lockdown may restrict some women’s access to support or escape and it may even curtail measures some men take to keep their own violence under control. “We have to be cautious about how we talk about increases in men killing women. Over the last 10 years, in the UK, a woman has been killed by a man every three days, by a partner or ex-partner, every four days. So if this was averaged out, we might expect to see seven women killed in 21 days. In reality, there are always times when the numbers are higher or lower. “But we can say that the number of women killed by men over the first three weeks since lockdown is the highest it’s been for at least 11 years and is double that of an average 21 days over the last 10 years.” Smith’s research shows at least seven people have been allegedly killed by partners or former partners during the period, while three people have been allegedly killed by their father. The committee also heard evidence from Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales. She said time limits on investigating crimes would need to be relaxed to allow survivors of violence in the home to report perpetrators once the coronavirus restrictions were eased. “I have heard from police about the need to extend the time by which people can report crimes. There are people who are experiencing abuse right now who aren’t able to call the police because it wouldn’t be safe for them,” said Jacobs. “But they may well want to report a crime later so we need to allow for some extension to what the normal timescales would be for that kind of thing.” Crimes that are “summary only”, which means that they can only be tried at a magistrates court, including common assault and harassment, must be prosecuted within six months. Jacobs said services must prepare for the “inevitable surge” of domestic abuse victims seeking support when the lockdown lifts. She said there were concerns that some of the millions of pounds of government funding announced for the charity sector may struggle to reach small local charities that supported specific groups. “We need to allow those charities to quickly and very simply bid in and get the funds they need to sustain what they are doing, but also plan for the inevitable surge that we will have.“There will be people that are waiting and trying to survive every day and then will access support as quickly as they can when some of the lockdown is lifted,” she told MPs. In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 200 247, or visit Women’s Aid. In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233). Other international helplines may be found via ww.befrienders.org</td>\n",

       "      <td>It was 2.30am when Daniel Jiménez was woken by his neighbour’s screams. When he went outside his home in the Los Pajarillos neighbourhood of Valladolid in north-west Spain, he saw a woman hanging from a third-storey window. Another neighbour rushed out with mattresses to help break her fall but he was too late. She fell to her death. Although the investigation into the 56-year-old woman has proved inconclusive, the interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, initially declared it a crime of gender violence. The Valladolid case aside, 18 women have been murdered in Spain this year by partners or ex-partners, making a grim total of 1,051 since 2003, when such crimes began to be recorded separately. Two have happened since Spain’s strict lockdown came into force on 14 March. There were 55 femicides last year. There are fears that the toll will increase with the lockdown. With no one allowed out except to buy food or medicine, women living with abusive partners have little chance to escape a situation made even more fraught by the coronavirus pandemic. In the first two weeks of April alone there was a 47% increase in calls to Spain’s domestic violence helpline over the same period last year. The number of women contacting support services, which have been designated as essential by the government, by email or on social media is said to have increased by as much as 700%. But there has been a sharp drop in complaints being made to the police. Ana Bella, a survivor of abuse who founded the Fundación Ana Bella to fight gender violence, said that in order to bring a formal complaint, women need the support of family and people around them and isolation is making this more difficult. “But the greatest barrier to reporting abuse is the emotional ties we have with the perpetrator,” she said. “It’s the only crime where the victim doesn’t want revenge but just to live in peace. It’s very difficult to report the father of your children to the police. Many women feel guilty because they’re going to send their children’s father to prison.” María Ángeles Carmona, president of the government agency dealing with gender violence, believes the drop in police reports can be partly attributed to restrictions on freedom of movement. “Around 30% of police complaints are about breaking restraining orders, but under the lockdown no one is allowed to leave their home,” she said. She added that many of the calls to the national helpline were about shared custody of children and visiting rights under the lockdown, but agreed that enforced confinement was inevitably heightening tensions in the home. Her department has published an online guide with advice on who to call for emergency, legal and psychological aid, or simply to talk, as well as what to do if someone has been threatened or is in danger. In the Canary Islands, where a 78-year-old woman was murdered in March by her husband, a scheme has been introduced to help women who might not be able to get away from an abusive partner for long enough to get help. A woman can simply go into a chemist and request a Mascarilla-19 face mask, the pharmacist then knows to call for help. The scheme has since been extended to other regions in Spain and beyond. Gender violence has a high profile in Spain but Bella said this is unlikely to be because rates are worse than other countries but because there has been a concerted effort to raise public and government awareness. According to the EU’s gender equality index devised in 2017, Spain scored betteron gender violence than France, Denmark, the UK and the EU average, but scored worse than most on failure to disclose, suggesting that reported cases are only the tip of the iceberg. “Spain is a pioneer in the fight against gender violence,” Carmona said. “It’s the first country to make it an issue of state, with specific legislation dating from 2004 and supported by all parliamentary parties in 2017. We’re a model for other countries, some of which don’t even keep official statistics of murdered women.” Over the past couple of years, Spain’s far-right Vox party has led a backlash against women’s rights, calling for laws intended to protect women to be repealed on the grounds that they discriminate against men. “Spain is one of the most advanced countries in gender equality and this is unstoppable, whatever Vox says,” Bella said. “They want to dilute gender violence into what they call family violence. There are women who mistreat others, of course. But it’s not the same as the unequal power relationship between a man and a woman. “I think we’re sufficiently mature as a society not to regress after all we’ve gone through to get here.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>At least 15m more cases of domestic violence are predicted around the world this year as a result of pandemic restrictions, according to new data that paints a bleak picture of life for women over the next decade. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) has also calculated that tens of millions of women will not be able to access modern contraceptives this year, and millions more girls will undergo female genital mutilation or be married off by 2030. Natalia Kanem, the fund’s executive director, called the findings “totally calamitous”. Authorities around the world have reported rising cases of abuse as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns. The figures, published on Tuesday by the UNFPA and its partners Avenir Health, Johns Hopkins University in the US and Victoria University in Australia, assume a 20% increase in violence during an average three-month lockdown in all 193 UN member states. The figures take into account the anticipated high levels of under-reported cases. Researchers expect 15m additional cases of domestic violence for every three months that lockdown is extended. They also estimate that the disruption to violence prevention programmes because of the pandemic and the diversion of resources elsewhere could mean a third fewer cases of violence are averted by 2030. Researchers also project that up to 44 million women in 114 low and middle-income countries will be unable to access contraceptives if lockdown and Covid-19 related restrictions continue for three months and cause major disruption to services. This would result in an estimated 1 million unintended pregnancies. The International Planned Parenthood Federation has reported that more than 5,00 clinics have closed in 64 countries and Marie Stopes International predicts that Covid-19 restrictions on its services could mean 3 million additional unintended pregnancies, 2.7 million unsafe abortions and 11,00 pregnancy-related deaths. The pandemic is also expected to derail efforts to end FGM. Researchers had expected the scaling up of FGM prevention programmes over the next 10 years would mean 5.3 million fewer girls being cut. This figure is projected to be reduced by a third. Meanwhile the disruption to programmes to prevent child marriage will result in an additional 13 million children being married over the next decade. World leaders have pledged to eliminate violence against women and girls, FGM and child marriage, as well as ensure universal access to family planning by 2030, under the sustainable development goals. “It’s a calamity. Totally calamitous,” said Kanem. “It is so clear that Covid-19 is compounding the no longer subterranean disparities that affect millions of women and girls.” She said the pandemic “threatened the gains carefully eked out” over recent years. “We are very worried indeed.” She said UNFPA teams in the Arab states and east and southern Africa had reported that “people were rushing to marry their daughters” already, while deaths in childbirth in one east African country had tripled this year. Wendo Aszed, the founder of Dandelion Africa, which runs economic empowerment programmes in Kenya’s Rift Valley, said it had been forced to reduce its mobile family planning services by 40% because of coronavirus restrictions. Many women in the region have up to eight children and live on about $1.50 (£1.20) a day. “On a bad day we will have 300 people [attend mobile clinics]. Some days we get up to 700 people showing up,” said Aszed. “That has been really impacted. We cannot treat women in these places.” She said that from mid-March to mid-April, more than 40 cases of violence have been reported to her organisation, more than the total number it dealt with last year. “A lot more women are a lot more aware that they can report and can leave marriages,” she said. “Women are fed up and they are seeing opportunities. With Covid things could get a lot worse so they need to deal with this problem and then can deal with Covid.” Traci Baird, president of EngenderHealth, said UNFPA had “put numbers to things that we have been discussing for weeks”. “The magnitude of the problem is absolutely enormous and that should motivate and mobilise us to take action now and be prepared to manage and support countries, and partners and families, in catching up after. “We know what works, we have best practices that have impact,” she added. “We have to do things better and faster and smarter. We don’t have time to do learnings and ramp up phases, or workshops and meetings. We have to get back to work.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Lockdowns around Latin America are helping slow the spread of COVID-19, but are having a darker and less-intended consequence: A spike in calls to helplines suggests a rise in domestic abuse, in a region where almost 20 million women and girls suffer sexual and physical violence each year. In cities from Buenos Aires to Mexico City, Santiago, São Paulo and La Paz, families and individuals have been confined in their homes in an unprecedented way, often only allowed out for emergencies or to shop for essentials. Prosecutors, victim support teams, women is movements and the United Nations all say this has caused a rise in domestic violence toward women. They cite increasing numbers of calls to abuse hotlines. In some countries, like Mexico and Brazil, there has been a rise in formal reports of abuse, while in others, including Chile and Bolivia, there has been a drop in formal complaints. Prosecutors and U.N. Women said the latter was likely not due to a decline in violence, but because women were less able to seek help or report abuse through normal channels. \"The jump in violence has not surprised us, it is the unleashing of a violence that was already there in people,\" said Eva Giberti, founder of the Victims Against Violence program in Argentina, who helps runs a hotline for women to report abuse. \"Under normal social circumstances that had been limited to some degree.\" Argentina is emergency 137 line for abuse victims, supported by the justice department, has seen a 67% rise in calls for help in April versus a year earlier, after a nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 20. U.N. Women in a report on Wednesday said there was evidence of rising violence against women in Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, and a doubling in the number of femicides in Argentina during the quarantine, citing a women is observatory in Mar del Plata. Pre-pandemic, the Argentine government estimates that a woman was killed every 23 hours. Domestic violence \"seems to be another pandemic,\" said Lucía Vassallo, a film maker whose documentary \"Line 137\" looks at the issue. 'They dare not go out' Rising concern over domestic abuse has been global, with fears victims are being silenced in Italy, calls for help from women rising in Spain, and systems to prevent child abuse in the United States hampered by the lockdown. In Latin America, the fear is that violence against women that was already prevalent is being exacerbated further. The region has seen huge marches and strikes by women over the last year against male aggression and abuse. \"In a situation of confinement, what is happening is that women are locked up with their own abusers in situations where they have very limited outlets,\" Maria Noel Baeza, regional director for U.N. Women, told Reuters. \"Last year we had 3,800 femicides in the region, how many are we going to have this year?\" In Chile, the women is minister said calls to domestic abuse helplines had increased 70% in the first weekend of quarantine. The government has bolstered counseling channels and looked to keep shelters open for women at risk. Evelyn Matthei, mayor of Santiago is wealthy Providencia district, told Reuters that calls for help to a local office providing legal, psychological and social help had leapt 500% under the lockdown. Formal reports of domestic violence, however, actually declined 40% in the first half of April in Chile, according to the national prosecutors' office, which the U.N. and prosecutors said was down to women having their movements restricted. \"This probably has to do with the fact that there is violence within the home but that women cannot go out, they dare not go out,\" said Matthei. Feminist manifesto In Brazil is Sao Paulo state, which has been hit hardest by the pandemic and imposed sweeping isolation measures, there was a 45% jump last month in cases of violence against women where police were dispatched, compared to a year earlier, according to thinktank the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. In Mexico, complaints to police of domestic violence rose around a quarter in March against a year earlier, official data show. \"Since the lockdown, there is been an increase in reports of domestic violence, many of those psychological violence,\" said Blanca Aquino, director of the Municipal Institute for Women of Veracruz, the Mexican state with the country is highest rate of femicides. Arussi Unda, from Mexican feminist organization Brujas del Mar, which offers advice to women in abuse cases, said initially many calls to the group had come from neighbors hearing fights in other houses. She said there had been a rise in cases of \"digital violence\" and recently women looking simply to escape. \"Now we get many women asking for advice on how to leave the house and take their children without the partner later wanting to take them away by legal means,\" she said. In Colombia, daily domestic violence calls to a national women is hotline were up nearly 130% during the first 18 days of the country is quarantine, according to government figures. The lockdown has been extended until May 11. Marta Dillon, an Argentine journalist and one of the founders of the \"Ni Una Menos\" women is movement, said women around the world were looking to unite to tackle the issue. \"Male violence has increased under the conditions of quarantine, of social isolation.. Us feminists have been saying this in Italy, in Turkey, in the United States. We are putting together a document amongst ourselves that will be a manifesto.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Add another public health crisis to the toll of the new coronavirus: Mounting data suggests that domestic abuse is acting like an opportunistic infection, flourishing in the conditions created by the pandemic. There was every reason to believe that the restrictions imposed to keep the virus from spreading would have such an effect, said Marianne Hester, a Bristol University sociologist who studies abusive relationships. Domestic violence goes up whenever families spend more time together, such as the Christmas and summer vacations, she said. Now, with families in lockdown worldwide, hotlines are lighting up with abuse reports, leaving governments trying to address a crisis that experts say they should have seen coming. [Read: As coronavirus grips Russia, an age-old bane returns: drinking],The United Nations called on Sunday for urgent action to combat the worldwide surge in domestic violence. “I urge all governments to put women’s safety first as they respond to the pandemic,” Secretary General António Guterres wrote on Twitter. But governments largely failed to prepare for the way the new public health measures would create opportunities for abusers to terrorize their victims. Now, many are scrambling to offer services to those at risk. But, as with the response to the virus itself, the delays mean that irreparable harm may already have occurred. As cities and towns across China locked down, a 26-year-old woman named Lele found herself entangled in more and more arguments with her husband, with whom she now had to spend every hour in their home in Anhui Province, in eastern China. On March 1, while Lele was holding her 11-month-old daughter, her husband began to beat her with a high chair. She is not sure how many times he hit her. Eventually, she says, one of her legs lost feeling and she fell to the ground, still holding the baby in her arms. A photograph she took after the incident shows the high chair lying on the floor in pieces, two of its metal legs snapped off — evidence of the force with which her husband wielded it against her. Another image documents Lele’s injuries: Nearly every inch of her lower legs was covered in bruises, a huge hematoma blooming on her left calf. Lele — her full name is not being used for her safety — said that her husband had abused her throughout their six-year relationship, but that the Covid-19 outbreak made things far worse. “During the epidemic, we were unable to go outside, and our conflicts just grew bigger and bigger and more and more frequent,” she said. “Everything was exposed.” As quarantines take effect around the world, that kind of “intimate terrorism” — a term many experts prefer for domestic violence — is flourishing. In China, a Beijing-based NGO dedicated to combating violence against women, Equality, has seen a surge in calls to its help line since early February, when the government locked down cities in Hubei Province, then the outbreak’s epicenter. In Spain, the emergency number for domestic violence received 18 percent more calls in the first two weeks of lockdown than in the same period a month earlier. “We’ve been getting some very distressing calls, showing us clearly just how intense psychological as well as physical mistreatment can get when people are kept 24 hours a day together within a reduced space,” said Ana Bella, who set up a foundation to help other women after surviving domestic violence herself. On Thursday, the French police reported a nationwide spike of about 30 percent in domestic violence. Christophe Castaner, the French interior minister, said he had asked officers to be on the lookout for abuse. “The risk increases due to confinement,” he said in an interview on French television.,In Spain, with the help of women’s associations, The New York Times contacted women stuck at home with an abusive husband or partner and conducted interviews over WhatsApp. One of them, Ana — who asked that her full name be withheld — shares an apartment with her partner, and says he has been regularly abusing her. He insists on total surveillance at all times. If she tries to lock herself in a room, he kicks the door until she opens it. “I can’t even have privacy in the bathroom — and now I have to endure this in a lockdown,” she wrote in a message sent late at night, to hide the communication from her husband. Judith Lewis Herman, a renowned trauma expert at Harvard University Medical School, has found that the coercive methods domestic abusers use to control their partners and children “bear an uncanny resemblance” to those kidnappers use to control hostages and repressive regimes use to break the will of political prisoners. “The methods which enable one human being to control another are remarkably consistent,” she wrote in a widely cited 1992 journal article. “While perpetrators of organized political or sexual exploitation may instruct each other in coercive methods, perpetrators of domestic abuse appear to reinvent them.” In addition to physical violence, which is not present in every abusive relationship, common tools of abuse include isolation from friends, family and employment; constant surveillance; strict, detailed rules for behavior; and restrictions on access to such basic necessities as food, clothing and sanitary facilities. Home isolation, however vital to the fight against the pandemic, is giving still more power to the abuser, Dr. Hester said. “If suddenly people have got to be at home,” she said, “that gives him an opportunity, suddenly, to call the shots around that. To say what she should be doing or shouldn’t.” The isolation has also shattered support networks, making it far more difficult for victims to get help or escape. After her husband attacked her with the high chair, Lele limped to the next room and called the police. When they arrived, however, they only documented the attack, then took no further action. Next, she hired a lawyer and filed for divorce — only to find that the epidemic had cut off that avenue of escape, too. Her divorce proceeding was postponed until April. She is still waiting for the court’s decision. And finding a new home amid the outbreak proved difficult, forcing Lele and her daughter to continue to live with their abuser for weeks. It is a pattern playing out around the world.,Institutions that are supposed to protect women from domestic violence, many weak and underfunded to begin with, are now straining to respond to the increased demand. Feng Yuan, a co-founder of Equality, the Chinese advocacy group, said she had one client who called an emergency line only to be told the police were too overstretched to help her. “We can come to your place after the crisis,” she recounted the operator saying.</td>\n",

       "      <td>One Queens man, angry that his children were crying, slapped his 2-year-old daughter and shoved his wife, prosecutors say. Another threw a glass baby bottle at his wife, enraged that she had left the house against his wishes during the shutdown. A third beat his girlfriend so badly that he broke a bone in her face after she took a long time to run an errand, prosecutors said. The attacks, described in Queens court documents, offer a glimpse of how social distancing and stay-at-home orders have fueled incidents of domestic violence in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic, even though police have recorded fewer crimes. Statistics actually suggest domestic violence is down in the city since the shutdown, even as it has risen statewide and around the world. Fewer victims of domestic abuse have been calling the police or the city’s hotline in recent weeks. But the drop in reports is far from reassuring, officials said, and law enforcement officials and social workers say there are some signs strife is quietly escalating behind closed doors. Calls to some organizations that provide shelter to battered women, for instance, have increased sharply. “Those stats are very scary,” said Melinda Katz, the district attorney in Queens, where domestic violence arrests have fallen nearly 40 percent. “The problem we think people are having is how to notify us.” The strict measures put in place to curb the spread of the virus in the city also have raised hurdles — and increased risks — for people seeking help, officials and social workers say. With schools and nonessential businesses shut, victims have lost opportunities to find privacy away from their abusers and seek help, such as going to work or walking children to school. Except for shelters, the physical spaces where victims could go to receive assistance — family justice centers, courts and nonprofit offices, for example — have gradually shifted operations online or over the phone. And the police and social workers have suspended home visits that are a crucial source of complaints. The Police Department said that reports of domestic violence have “progressively declined” since the onset of the pandemic. The crimes, which include beatings, break-ins and killings primarily among couples and families, fell nearly 15 percent last month compared to March 2019. The police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, has asked domestic violence officers in the precincts to reach out to people they know have been victims in the past or might be vulnerable and check on them. “What I’m concerned about is it’s happening and it’s not getting reported, and I think that’s a reality we should all face,” Mr. Shea said. The reported downturn in domestic violence in the city contrasts with a spike reported statewide. For example, State Police troopers responded to 1,753 domestic violence calls last month, a 15 percent increase from March 2019, when there were 1,522 calls, a spokesman said. The police agencies serve vastly different populations. New York City officers patrol a dense city where victims usually have other options than calling the police. State troopers, on the other hand, are often the only resource for miles in some of the state’s rural communities. The split between the city and the state was also reflected in calls to domestic violence hotlines. Calls to the state hotline increased nearly 18 percent last month compared to February. The city hotline, operated by Safe Horizon, a nonprofit, saw an 11 percent drop over the same period, although use of its online chat service increased. Some shelter providers in the city, however, have seen their phones light up. The Violence Intervention Program, a nonprofit that operates a shelter and serves primarily Latin American women, saw an increase of nearly 35 percent in calls to its help line in March compared to February, primarily from victims seeking emergency shelter. And recent arrests in the city suggest the crisis is putting pressure on some troubled families, whose members suddenly find themselves confined at home together nearly all day, every day. Mohammad Mohebi, 27, the man who the police say slapped his daughter, was usually at work during the day, while the girl and her younger sister were at school or with their grandmother. His wife, a graduate student, was usually at school, too, but the couple and their two daughters were all sheltering in place in their apartment in downtown Flushing, officials said. The woman who prosecutors say was attacked by her boyfriend had gone to a store only to find it was closed. She went to another store and returned to her loft apartment in Long Island City around 7 p.m. There, she was confronted by her boyfriend, Azael Montejo, 35, who was visibly drunk, the woman told the police. According to a criminal complaint, Mr. Montejo hit her in the face, then threatened her. “This is not physical,” Mr. Montejo said, according to the document. “If I am ever physical, you will not wake up in the morning.” He continued punching her in the face several times, then wrapped his arms around her neck and choked her, the complaint said. Finally, Mr. Montejo picked up a trash can and hit her in the face with it, the document said. She was treated at Elmhurst Hospital for a facial fracture, swelling and bruising. He has been charged with second-degree strangulation.,Margarita Guzmán, the executive director of the Violence Intervention Program, said many victims who called her organization for help ultimately decided against going into shelter for fear of contracting the virus. She cited the example of a woman who called last month and said she wanted to leave her abusive husband, but she decided the risk of exposing herself or her infant to the virus at a shelter was too high. “It’s really, for her, a choice between whether she stays with the devil she knows, or whether she risks what could be increased safety from the abuse but could also mean increased risk of the virus, and both with potentially lethal factors at the ends of it,” Ms. Guzmán said.</td>\n",

Britain is enduring its fifth week of a national lockdown, with businesses shuttered and citizens ordered to stay at home as the government tries to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and stop health services becoming overwhelmed. However, London is Metropolitan Police service said that while the lockdown was vital to the national effort it has also left \"current and potential victims of domestic abuse even more vulnerable and isolated.\" The force said calls about domestic abuse had gone up by around a third in the last six weeks and that its officers were making around 100 arrests a day for such offences. There was a 9% rise in recorded incidents compared to a year ago. \"No-one who is experiencing domestic abuse should feel that they have to suffer in silence,\" said senior police office Sue Williams.</td>\n",

       "      <td>BUENOS AIRES/SANTIAGO/MEXICO CITY/LA PAZ — Lockdowns around Latin America are helping slow the spread of COVID-19, but are having a darker and less-intended consequence: a spike in calls to helplines suggests a rise in domestic abuse, in a region where almost 20 million women and girls suffer sexual and physical violence each year. In cities from Buenos Aires to Mexico City, Santiago, São Paulo and La Paz, families and individuals have been confined in their homes in an unprecedented way, often only allowed out for emergencies or to shop for essentials. Prosecutors, victim support teams, women is movements and the United Nations all say this has caused a rise in domestic violence towards women. They cite increasing numbers of calls to abuse hotlines. In some countries, like Mexico and Brazil, there has been a rise in formal reports of abuse, while in others, including Chile and Bolivia, there has been a drop in formal complaints. Prosecutors and UN Women said the latter was likely not due to a decline in violence, but because women were less able to seek help or report abuse through normal channels. \"The jump in violence has not surprised us, it is the unleashing of a violence that was already there in people,\" said Eva Giberti, founder of the Victims Against Violence program in Argentina, who helps runs a hotline for women to report abuse. \"Under normal social circumstances that had been limited to some degree.\",Argentina is emergency 137 line for abuse victims, supported by the justice department, has seen a 67% rise in calls for help in April versus a year earlier, after a nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 20. UN Women in a report on Wednesday said there was evidence of rising violence against women in Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, and a doubling in the number of femicides in Argentina during the quarantine, citing a women is observatory in Mar del Plata. Pre-pandemic, the Argentine government estimates that a woman was killed every 23 hours.,Domestic violence \"seems to be another pandemic,\" said Lucía Vassallo, a film maker whose documentary \"Line 137\" looks at the issue. 'THEY DARE NOT GO OUT',Rising concern over domestic abuse has been global, with fears victims are being silenced in Italy, calls for help from women rising in Spain, and systems to prevent child abuse in the United States hampered by the lockdown. In Latin America, the fear is that violence against women that was already prevalent is being exacerbated further. The region has seen huge marches and strikes by women over the last year against male aggression and abuse. \"In a situation of confinement, what is happening is that women are locked up with their own abusers in situations where they have very limited outlets,\" Maria Noel Baeza, regional director for UN Women, told Reuters. \"Last year we had 3,800 femicides in the region, how many are we going to have this year?\",In Chile, the women is minister said calls to domestic abuse helplines had increased 70% in the first weekend of quarantine. The government has bolstered counseling channels and looked to keep shelters open for women at risk. Evelyn Matthei, mayor of Santiago is wealthy Providencia district, told Reuters that calls for help to a local office providing legal, psychological and social help had leapt 500% under the lockdown. Formal reports of domestic violence, however, actually declined 40% in the first half of April in Chile, according to the national prosecutors' office, which the UN and prosecutors said was down to women having their movements restricted. \"This probably has to do with the fact that there is violence within the home but that women cannot go out, they dare not go out,\" said Matthei.

       "      <td>The Government has moved to reassure victims of domestic violence that services of the State remain available to them. Liz Canavan, Assistant Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach, said the 2km travel restriction did not apply to people trying to escape domestic abuse. At this morning is briefing, Ms Canavan said at a time when people are asked to stay at home, the Government is conscious it may not be a safe place for some people. She added that gardaí have been asked to prioritise suspected instances of domestic abuse, and that other frontline services remain available to potential victims. The Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan launched a campaign this morning to ensure victims are aware of what services are available. From next week new television and radio adverts will be aired, which will reflect the particular issues raised for some by the need to stay at home. Minister Flanagan said: \"This is a really important campaign. At a time when we have all been told to stay at home, I am very conscious that for victims of domestic abuse, home can be anything but a safe place. \"That is why I want victims to know that they will continue to receive the highest priority from the civil and criminal justice system throughout this crisis. I want perpetrators to know that too.\" Meanwhile, the demand for Childline has continued to grow since restrictions were put in place, according to the Director of Services with the ISPCC. Last month the charity reported a surge in calls after schools were closed and restrictions were imposed on gatherings. Speaking on RTÉ is Today with Damien O'Reilly, Caroline O'Sullivan of the ISPCC said the demand has continued to grow, but has now been more focused on the organisation is text and live messaging services. She said this is because children want their conversations to remain private and some children are living in fear of something happening in the home. She said while abuse may not be happening 24 hours a day, some children are living in fear that they or a sibling will say or do something that may lead to an incident. \"The reality is these restrictions which have been put in place for very good reason are exacerbating the abuse scenarios that some children are living in. If you take a child that lives in a domestic violence situation, they are living in that now 24 hours a day.\" Ms O'Sullivan said that the amount of alcohol being drank in homes is leading to an increase similar to that seen around the Christmas period. The Chief Executive of the Children is Rights Alliance said the restrictions are increasing pressure on already vulnerable families and children. Speaking on the same programme, Tanya Ward said that a lot of child safety plans are dependent on children having contact with professionals like teachers, public health nurses and youth workers who can see if something is wrong. She said this has had a knock-on effect on the amount of child protection referrals being made. Ms Ward said a lot of social workers are stilling meeting families, and charities and support organisations are still working with vulnerable people, but not at the same levels. She also said that the restrictions imposed by the Government are leading to an increase in \"toxic stress\" in homes as families approach \"breaking point\". Ms Ward said that they need to look at how to support these families in the future. Meanwhile, a project leader with Barnardos in Cork has said she is really concerned about children living in emergency accommodation during the period of restrictions. Roisin McDaid said parents are reporting children in those situations \"really struggling\" as they are confined to hotel rooms. She said this is having an impact on their ability to access academic work. \"They can not find a quiet space to do that and open a book,\" she said. Reporting Aisling Kenny, Peter Farrell</td>\n",

       "0  Up to 9.5 million women and girls could miss out on vital family planning services this year because of Covid-19, potentially resulting in thousands of deaths. Marie Stopes International warned on Friday that travel restrictions and lockdowns could have a devastating affect on women as they struggle to collect contraceptives and access other reproductive healthcare services, such as safe abortions, across the 37 countries in which it works. MSI estimates that with an 80% reduction in service delivery for three months, and minimal services for the remainder of the year, 9.5 million people will miss out. If things were to return to normal after three months of disruption, the figure would drop to 4 million. The organisation predicts that the loss of services could result in as many as 3 million additional unintended pregnancies, 2.7 million unsafe abortions and 11,00 pregnancy-related deaths. Last year, 32 million women used contraceptives provided by MSI, which is now calling on governments around the world to include reproductive healthcare on its list of essential services. Marie Stopes UK said it was open for business as usual. Simon Cooke, MSI’s chief executive, said: “Women and girls will pay the price if governments do not act now to safeguard access to essential healthcare, including safe abortion and contraception.” In Nepal, the start of a national lockdown on 24 March immediately forced the closure of Marie Stopes clinics across the country. The government has now issued passes allowing health workers to travel to the clinics and some are beginning to reopen. Marie Stopes Nepal reported an increased number of calls from women wanting abortion services since the start of the lockdown. In Sierra Leone, Felix Ikenna, a doctor and quality assurance director for MSI, pointed to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 as evidence of the importance of providing reproductive healthcare services. Researchers found that the closure of clinics and reduced reproductive healthcare services led to between 3,600 and 4,900 additional maternal, neonatal and stillbirth deaths between 2014 and 2015, compared with 4,00 deaths from the Ebola virus itself during the entire epidemic. “People will always need services, irrespective of an epidemic,” said Ikenna. “During Ebola, the number of women we saw went up as word spread that we were still open. “The crisis led to a spike in the number of teenage pregnancies. People were too afraid to go to hospital or government facilities. If we had stopped providing contraception and post-abortion care, it would have been much worse.” A briefing paper, published by the UN population fund last month, warned that the availability and distribution of contraceptives and other maternal health medicines were already being hampered by the pandemic. “This could have life-threatening consequences and reverse recent gains to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health,” it said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1  At least 16 suspected domestic abuse killings in the UK have been identified by campaigners since the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed, far higher than the average rate for the time of year, it has emerged. Karen Ingala Smith, the founder of Counting Dead Women, a pioneering project that records the killing of women by men in the UK, has identified at least 16 killings between 23 March and 12 April, including those of children. Looking at the same period over the last 10 years, Smith’s data records an average of five deaths. Her findings for 2020, which are collated from internet searches and people contacting over social media, were raised during evidence to the home affairs select ommittee on Wednesday. Dame Vera Baird QC, the victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, told MPs at the remote session: “Counting Dead Women has got to a total of 16 domestic abuse killings in the last three weeks. We usually say there are two a week, that looks to me like five a week, that’s the size of this crisis.” A number of domestic abuse charities and campaigners have reported a surge in calls to helplines and online services since the lockdown conditions were imposed, reflecting experiences in other countries. Smith, who is also chief executive of a domestic abuse charity, said: “I don’t believe coronavirus creates violent men. What we’re seeing is a window into the levels of abuse that women live with all the time. Coronavirus may exacerbate triggers, though I might prefer to call them excuses. Lockdown may restrict some women’s access to support or escape and it may even curtail measures some men take to keep their own violence under control. “We have to be cautious about how we talk about increases in men killing women. Over the last 10 years, in the UK, a woman has been killed by a man every three days, by a partner or ex-partner, every four days. So if this was averaged out, we might expect to see seven women killed in 21 days. In reality, there are always times when the numbers are higher or lower. “But we can say that the number of women killed by men over the first three weeks since lockdown is the highest it’s been for at least 11 years and is double that of an average 21 days over the last 10 years.” Smith’s research shows at least seven people have been allegedly killed by partners or former partners during the period, while three people have been allegedly killed by their father. The committee also heard evidence from Nicole Jacobs, the domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales. She said time limits on investigating crimes would need to be relaxed to allow survivors of violence in the home to report perpetrators once the coronavirus restrictions were eased. “I have heard from police about the need to extend the time by which people can report crimes. There are people who are experiencing abuse right now who aren’t able to call the police because it wouldn’t be safe for them,” said Jacobs. “But they may well want to report a crime later so we need to allow for some extension to what the normal timescales would be for that kind of thing.” Crimes that are “summary only”, which means that they can only be tried at a magistrates court, including common assault and harassment, must be prosecuted within six months. Jacobs said services must prepare for the “inevitable surge” of domestic abuse victims seeking support when the lockdown lifts. She said there were concerns that some of the millions of pounds of government funding announced for the charity sector may struggle to reach small local charities that supported specific groups. “We need to allow those charities to quickly and very simply bid in and get the funds they need to sustain what they are doing, but also plan for the inevitable surge that we will have.“There will be people that are waiting and trying to survive every day and then will access support as quickly as they can when some of the lockdown is lifted,” she told MPs.

       "2  It was 2.30am when Daniel Jiménez was woken by his neighbour’s screams. When he went outside his home in the Los Pajarillos neighbourhood of Valladolid in north-west Spain, he saw a woman hanging from a third-storey window. Another neighbour rushed out with mattresses to help break her fall but he was too late. She fell to her death. Although the investigation into the 56-year-old woman has proved inconclusive, the interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, initially declared it a crime of gender violence. The Valladolid case aside, 18 women have been murdered in Spain this year by partners or ex-partners, making a grim total of 1,051 since 2003, when such crimes began to be recorded separately. Two have happened since Spain’s strict lockdown came into force on 14 March. There were 55 femicides last year. There are fears that the toll will increase with the lockdown. With no one allowed out except to buy food or medicine, women living with abusive partners have little chance to escape a situation made even more fraught by the coronavirus pandemic. In the first two weeks of April alone there was a 47% increase in calls to Spain’s domestic violence helpline over the same period last year. The number of women contacting support services, which have been designated as essential by the government, by email or on social media is said to have increased by as much as 700%. But there has been a sharp drop in complaints being made to the police. Ana Bella, a survivor of abuse who founded the Fundación Ana Bella to fight gender violence, said that in order to bring a formal complaint, women need the support of family and people around them and isolation is making this more difficult. “But the greatest barrier to reporting abuse is the emotional ties we have with the perpetrator,” she said. “It’s the only crime where the victim doesn’t want revenge but just to live in peace. It’s very difficult to report the father of your children to the police. Many women feel guilty because they’re going to send their children’s father to prison.” María Ángeles Carmona, president of the government agency dealing with gender violence, believes the drop in police reports can be partly attributed to restrictions on freedom of movement. “Around 30% of police complaints are about breaking restraining orders, but under the lockdown no one is allowed to leave their home,” she said. She added that many of the calls to the national helpline were about shared custody of children and visiting rights under the lockdown, but agreed that enforced confinement was inevitably heightening tensions in the home. Her department has published an online guide with advice on who to call for emergency, legal and psychological aid, or simply to talk, as well as what to do if someone has been threatened or is in danger. In the Canary Islands, where a 78-year-old woman was murdered in March by her husband, a scheme has been introduced to help women who might not be able to get away from an abusive partner for long enough to get help. A woman can simply go into a chemist and request a Mascarilla-19 face mask, the pharmacist then knows to call for help. The scheme has since been extended to other regions in Spain and beyond. Gender violence has a high profile in Spain but Bella said this is unlikely to be because rates are worse than other countries but because there has been a concerted effort to raise public and government awareness. According to the EU’s gender equality index devised in 2017, Spain scored betteron gender violence than France, Denmark, the UK and the EU average, but scored worse than most on failure to disclose, suggesting that reported cases are only the tip of the iceberg. “Spain is a pioneer in the fight against gender violence,” Carmona said. “It’s the first country to make it an issue of state, with specific legislation dating from 2004 and supported by all parliamentary parties in 2017. We’re a model for other countries, some of which don’t even keep official statistics of murdered women.” Over the past couple of years, Spain’s far-right Vox party has led a backlash against women’s rights, calling for laws intended to protect women to be repealed on the grounds that they discriminate against men. “Spain is one of the most advanced countries in gender equality and this is unstoppable, whatever Vox says,” Bella said. “They want to dilute gender violence into what they call family violence. There are women who mistreat others, of course. But it’s not the same as the unequal power relationship between a man and a woman. “I think we’re sufficiently mature as a society not to regress after all we’ve gone through to get here.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "3  At least 15m more cases of domestic violence are predicted around the world this year as a result of pandemic restrictions, according to new data that paints a bleak picture of life for women over the next decade. The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) has also calculated that tens of millions of women will not be able to access modern contraceptives this year, and millions more girls will undergo female genital mutilation or be married off by 2030. Natalia Kanem, the fund’s executive director, called the findings “totally calamitous”. Authorities around the world have reported rising cases of abuse as a result of Covid-19 lockdowns. The figures, published on Tuesday by the UNFPA and its partners Avenir Health, Johns Hopkins University in the US and Victoria University in Australia, assume a 20% increase in violence during an average three-month lockdown in all 193 UN member states. The figures take into account the anticipated high levels of under-reported cases. Researchers expect 15m additional cases of domestic violence for every three months that lockdown is extended. They also estimate that the disruption to violence prevention programmes because of the pandemic and the diversion of resources elsewhere could mean a third fewer cases of violence are averted by 2030. Researchers also project that up to 44 million women in 114 low and middle-income countries will be unable to access contraceptives if lockdown and Covid-19 related restrictions continue for three months and cause major disruption to services. This would result in an estimated 1 million unintended pregnancies. The International Planned Parenthood Federation has reported that more than 5,00 clinics have closed in 64 countries and Marie Stopes International predicts that Covid-19 restrictions on its services could mean 3 million additional unintended pregnancies, 2.7 million unsafe abortions and 11,00 pregnancy-related deaths. The pandemic is also expected to derail efforts to end FGM. Researchers had expected the scaling up of FGM prevention programmes over the next 10 years would mean 5.3 million fewer girls being cut. This figure is projected to be reduced by a third. Meanwhile the disruption to programmes to prevent child marriage will result in an additional 13 million children being married over the next decade. World leaders have pledged to eliminate violence against women and girls, FGM and child marriage, as well as ensure universal access to family planning by 2030, under the sustainable development goals. “It’s a calamity. Totally calamitous,” said Kanem. “It is so clear that Covid-19 is compounding the no longer subterranean disparities that affect millions of women and girls.” She said the pandemic “threatened the gains carefully eked out” over recent years. “We are very worried indeed.” She said UNFPA teams in the Arab states and east and southern Africa had reported that “people were rushing to marry their daughters” already, while deaths in childbirth in one east African country had tripled this year. Wendo Aszed, the founder of Dandelion Africa, which runs economic empowerment programmes in Kenya’s Rift Valley, said it had been forced to reduce its mobile family planning services by 40% because of coronavirus restrictions. Many women in the region have up to eight children and live on about $1.50 (£1.20) a day. “On a bad day we will have 300 people [attend mobile clinics]. Some days we get up to 700 people showing up,” said Aszed. “That has been really impacted. We cannot treat women in these places.” She said that from mid-March to mid-April, more than 40 cases of violence have been reported to her organisation, more than the total number it dealt with last year. “A lot more women are a lot more aware that they can report and can leave marriages,” she said. “Women are fed up and they are seeing opportunities. With Covid things could get a lot worse so they need to deal with this problem and then can deal with Covid.” Traci Baird, president of EngenderHealth, said UNFPA had “put numbers to things that we have been discussing for weeks”. “The magnitude of the problem is absolutely enormous and that should motivate and mobilise us to take action now and be prepared to manage and support countries, and partners and families, in catching up after. “We know what works, we have best practices that have impact,” she added. “We have to do things better and faster and smarter. We don’t have time to do learnings and ramp up phases, or workshops and meetings. We have to get back to work.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "4  Lockdowns around Latin America are helping slow the spread of COVID-19, but are having a darker and less-intended consequence: A spike in calls to helplines suggests a rise in domestic abuse, in a region where almost 20 million women and girls suffer sexual and physical violence each year. In cities from Buenos Aires to Mexico City, Santiago, São Paulo and La Paz, families and individuals have been confined in their homes in an unprecedented way, often only allowed out for emergencies or to shop for essentials. Prosecutors, victim support teams, women is movements and the United Nations all say this has caused a rise in domestic violence toward women. They cite increasing numbers of calls to abuse hotlines. In some countries, like Mexico and Brazil, there has been a rise in formal reports of abuse, while in others, including Chile and Bolivia, there has been a drop in formal complaints. Prosecutors and U.N. Women said the latter was likely not due to a decline in violence, but because women were less able to seek help or report abuse through normal channels. \"The jump in violence has not surprised us, it is the unleashing of a violence that was already there in people,\" said Eva Giberti, founder of the Victims Against Violence program in Argentina, who helps runs a hotline for women to report abuse. \"Under normal social circumstances that had been limited to some degree.\" Argentina is emergency 137 line for abuse victims, supported by the justice department, has seen a 67% rise in calls for help in April versus a year earlier, after a nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 20. U.N. Women in a report on Wednesday said there was evidence of rising violence against women in Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, and a doubling in the number of femicides in Argentina during the quarantine, citing a women is observatory in Mar del Plata. Pre-pandemic, the Argentine government estimates that a woman was killed every 23 hours. Domestic violence \"seems to be another pandemic,\" said Lucía Vassallo, a film maker whose documentary \"Line 137\" looks at the issue. 'They dare not go out' Rising concern over domestic abuse has been global, with fears victims are being silenced in Italy, calls for help from women rising in Spain, and systems to prevent child abuse in the United States hampered by the lockdown. In Latin America, the fear is that violence against women that was already prevalent is being exacerbated further. The region has seen huge marches and strikes by women over the last year against male aggression and abuse. \"In a situation of confinement, what is happening is that women are locked up with their own abusers in situations where they have very limited outlets,\" Maria Noel Baeza, regional director for U.N. Women, told Reuters. \"Last year we had 3,800 femicides in the region, how many are we going to have this year?\" In Chile, the women is minister said calls to domestic abuse helplines had increased 70% in the first weekend of quarantine. The government has bolstered counseling channels and looked to keep shelters open for women at risk. Evelyn Matthei, mayor of Santiago is wealthy Providencia district, told Reuters that calls for help to a local office providing legal, psychological and social help had leapt 500% under the lockdown. Formal reports of domestic violence, however, actually declined 40% in the first half of April in Chile, according to the national prosecutors' office, which the U.N. and prosecutors said was down to women having their movements restricted. \"This probably has to do with the fact that there is violence within the home but that women cannot go out, they dare not go out,\" said Matthei. Feminist manifesto In Brazil is Sao Paulo state, which has been hit hardest by the pandemic and imposed sweeping isolation measures, there was a 45% jump last month in cases of violence against women where police were dispatched, compared to a year earlier, according to thinktank the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. In Mexico, complaints to police of domestic violence rose around a quarter in March against a year earlier, official data show. \"Since the lockdown, there is been an increase in reports of domestic violence, many of those psychological violence,\" said Blanca Aquino, director of the Municipal Institute for Women of Veracruz, the Mexican state with the country is highest rate of femicides. Arussi Unda, from Mexican feminist organization Brujas del Mar, which offers advice to women in abuse cases, said initially many calls to the group had come from neighbors hearing fights in other houses. She said there had been a rise in cases of \"digital violence\" and recently women looking simply to escape. \"Now we get many women asking for advice on how to leave the house and take their children without the partner later wanting to take them away by legal means,\" she said. In Colombia, daily domestic violence calls to a national women is hotline were up nearly 130% during the first 18 days of the country is quarantine, according to government figures. The lockdown has been extended until May 11. Marta Dillon, an Argentine journalist and one of the founders of the \"Ni Una Menos\" women is movement, said women around the world were looking to unite to tackle the issue. \"Male violence has increased under the conditions of quarantine, of social isolation.. Us feminists have been saying this in Italy, in Turkey, in the United States.

There was every reason to believe that the restrictions imposed to keep the virus from spreading would have such an effect, said Marianne Hester, a Bristol University sociologist who studies abusive relationships. Domestic violence goes up whenever families spend more time together, such as the Christmas and summer vacations, she said. Now, with families in lockdown worldwide, hotlines are lighting up with abuse reports, leaving governments trying to address a crisis that experts say they should have seen coming. [Read: As coronavirus grips Russia, an age-old bane returns: drinking],The United Nations called on Sunday for urgent action to combat the worldwide surge in domestic violence. “I urge all governments to put women’s safety first as they respond to the pandemic,” Secretary General António Guterres wrote on Twitter. But governments largely failed to prepare for the way the new public health measures would create opportunities for abusers to terrorize their victims. Now, many are scrambling to offer services to those at risk. But, as with the response to the virus itself, the delays mean that irreparable harm may already have occurred. As cities and towns across China locked down, a 26-year-old woman named Lele found herself entangled in more and more arguments with her husband, with whom she now had to spend every hour in their home in Anhui Province, in eastern China. On March 1, while Lele was holding her 11-month-old daughter, her husband began to beat her with a high chair. She is not sure how many times he hit her. Eventually, she says, one of her legs lost feeling and she fell to the ground, still holding the baby in her arms. A photograph she took after the incident shows the high chair lying on the floor in pieces, two of its metal legs snapped off — evidence of the force with which her husband wielded it against her. Another image documents Lele’s injuries: Nearly every inch of her lower legs was covered in bruises, a huge hematoma blooming on her left calf. Lele — her full name is not being used for her safety — said that her husband had abused her throughout their six-year relationship, but that the Covid-19 outbreak made things far worse. “During the epidemic, we were unable to go outside, and our conflicts just grew bigger and bigger and more and more frequent,” she said. “Everything was exposed.” As quarantines take effect around the world, that kind of “intimate terrorism” — a term many experts prefer for domestic violence — is flourishing. In China, a Beijing-based NGO dedicated to combating violence against women, Equality, has seen a surge in calls to its help line since early February, when the government locked down cities in Hubei Province, then the outbreak’s epicenter. In Spain, the emergency number for domestic violence received 18 percent more calls in the first two weeks of lockdown than in the same period a month earlier. “We’ve been getting some very distressing calls, showing us clearly just how intense psychological as well as physical mistreatment can get when people are kept 24 hours a day together within a reduced space,” said Ana Bella, who set up a foundation to help other women after surviving domestic violence herself. On Thursday, the French police reported a nationwide spike of about 30 percent in domestic violence. Christophe Castaner, the French interior minister, said he had asked officers to be on the lookout for abuse. “The risk increases due to confinement,” he said in an interview on French television.,In Spain, with the help of women’s associations, The New York Times contacted women stuck at home with an abusive husband or partner and conducted interviews over WhatsApp. One of them, Ana — who asked that her full name be withheld — shares an apartment with her partner, and says he has been regularly abusing her. He insists on total surveillance at all times. If she tries to lock herself in a room, he kicks the door until she opens it. “I can’t even have privacy in the bathroom — and now I have to endure this in a lockdown,” she wrote in a message sent late at night, to hide the communication from her husband. Judith Lewis Herman, a renowned trauma expert at Harvard University Medical School, has found that the coercive methods domestic abusers use to control their partners and children “bear an uncanny resemblance” to those kidnappers use to control hostages and repressive regimes use to break the will of political prisoners. “The methods which enable one human being to control another are remarkably consistent,” she wrote in a widely cited 1992 journal article. “While perpetrators of organized political or sexual exploitation may instruct each other in coercive methods, perpetrators of domestic abuse appear to reinvent them.” In addition to physical violence, which is not present in every abusive relationship, common tools of abuse include isolation from friends, family and employment; constant surveillance; strict, detailed rules for behavior; and restrictions on access to such basic necessities as food, clothing and sanitary facilities. Home isolation, however vital to the fight against the pandemic, is giving still more power to the abuser, Dr. Hester said. “If suddenly people have got to be at home,” she said, “that gives him an opportunity, suddenly, to call the shots around that. To say what she should be doing or shouldn’t.” The isolation has also shattered support networks, making it far more difficult for victims to get help or escape. After her husband attacked her with the high chair, Lele limped to the next room and called the police. When they arrived, however, they only documented the attack, then took no further action. Next, she hired a lawyer and filed for divorce — only to find that the epidemic had cut off that avenue of escape, too. Her divorce proceeding was postponed until April. She is still waiting for the court’s decision. And finding a new home amid the outbreak proved difficult, forcing Lele and her daughter to continue to live with their abuser for weeks. It is a pattern playing out around the world.,Institutions that are supposed to protect women from domestic violence, many weak and underfunded to begin with, are now straining to respond to the increased demand. Feng Yuan, a co-founder of Equality, the Chinese advocacy group, said she had one client who called an emergency line only to be told the police were too overstretched to help her. “We can come to your place after the crisis,” she recounted the operator saying.  \n",
       "6  One Queens man, angry that his children were crying, slapped his 2-year-old daughter and shoved his wife, prosecutors say. Another threw a glass baby bottle at his wife, enraged that she had left the house against his wishes during the shutdown. A third beat his girlfriend so badly that he broke a bone in her face after she took a long time to run an errand, prosecutors said. The attacks, described in Queens court documents, offer a glimpse of how social distancing and stay-at-home orders have fueled incidents of domestic violence in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic, even though police have recorded fewer crimes. Statistics actually suggest domestic violence is down in the city since the shutdown, even as it has risen statewide and around the world. Fewer victims of domestic abuse have been calling the police or the city’s hotline in recent weeks. But the drop in reports is far from reassuring, officials said, and law enforcement officials and social workers say there are some signs strife is quietly escalating behind closed doors. Calls to some organizations that provide shelter to battered women, for instance, have increased sharply. “Those stats are very scary,” said Melinda Katz, the district attorney in Queens, where domestic violence arrests have fallen nearly 40 percent. “The problem we think people are having is how to notify us.” The strict measures put in place to curb the spread of the virus in the city also have raised hurdles — and increased risks — for people seeking help, officials and social workers say. With schools and nonessential businesses shut, victims have lost opportunities to find privacy away from their abusers and seek help, such as going to work or walking children to school. Except for shelters, the physical spaces where victims could go to receive assistance — family justice centers, courts and nonprofit offices, for example — have gradually shifted operations online or over the phone. And the police and social workers have suspended home visits that are a crucial source of complaints. The Police Department said that reports of domestic violence have “progressively declined” since the onset of the pandemic. The crimes, which include beatings, break-ins and killings primarily among couples and families, fell nearly 15 percent last month compared to March 2019. The police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, has asked domestic violence officers in the precincts to reach out to people they know have been victims in the past or might be vulnerable and check on them. “What I’m concerned about is it’s happening and it’s not getting reported, and I think that’s a reality we should all face,” Mr. Shea said. The reported downturn in domestic violence in the city contrasts with a spike reported statewide. For example, State Police troopers responded to 1,753 domestic violence calls last month, a 15 percent increase from March 2019, when there were 1,522 calls, a spokesman said. The police agencies serve vastly different populations. New York City officers patrol a dense city where victims usually have other options than calling the police. State troopers, on the other hand, are often the only resource for miles in some of the state’s rural communities. The split between the city and the state was also reflected in calls to domestic violence hotlines. Calls to the state hotline increased nearly 18 percent last month compared to February. The city hotline, operated by Safe Horizon, a nonprofit, saw an 11 percent drop over the same period, although use of its online chat service increased. Some shelter providers in the city, however, have seen their phones light up. The Violence Intervention Program, a nonprofit that operates a shelter and serves primarily Latin American women, saw an increase of nearly 35 percent in calls to its help line in March compared to February, primarily from victims seeking emergency shelter. And recent arrests in the city suggest the crisis is putting pressure on some troubled families, whose members suddenly find themselves confined at home together nearly all day, every day. Mohammad Mohebi, 27, the man who the police say slapped his daughter, was usually at work during the day, while the girl and her younger sister were at school or with their grandmother. His wife, a graduate student, was usually at school, too, but the couple and their two daughters were all sheltering in place in their apartment in downtown Flushing, officials said. The woman who prosecutors say was attacked by her boyfriend had gone to a store only to find it was closed. She went to another store and returned to her loft apartment in Long Island City around 7 p.m. There, she was confronted by her boyfriend, Azael Montejo, 35, who was visibly drunk, the woman told the police. According to a criminal complaint, Mr. Montejo hit her in the face, then threatened her. “This is not physical,” Mr. Montejo said, according to the document. “If I am ever physical, you will not wake up in the morning.” He continued punching her in the face several times, then wrapped his arms around her neck and choked her, the complaint said. Finally, Mr. Montejo picked up a trash can and hit her in the face with it, the document said. She was treated at Elmhurst Hospital for a facial fracture, swelling and bruising. He has been charged with second-degree strangulation.,Margarita Guzmán, the executive director of the Violence Intervention Program, said many victims who called her organization for help ultimately decided against going into shelter for fear of contracting the virus. She cited the example of a woman who called last month and said she wanted to leave her abusive husband, but she decided the risk of exposing herself or her infant to the virus at a shelter was too high. “It’s really, for her, a choice between whether she stays with the devil she knows, or whether she risks what could be increased safety from the abuse but could also mean increased risk of the virus, and both with potentially lethal factors at the ends of it,” Ms. Guzmán said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "7  LONDON — Reports of domestic violence in London have risen by a third in the last six weeks, police said on Friday, urging victims to speak out and promising they will not be punished if they need to break social distancing guidelines. Britain is enduring its fifth week of a national lockdown, with businesses shuttered and citizens ordered to stay at home as the government tries to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and stop health services becoming overwhelmed. However, London is Metropolitan Police service said that while the lockdown was vital to the national effort it has also left \"current and potential victims of domestic abuse even more vulnerable and isolated.\" The force said calls about domestic abuse had gone up by around a third in the last six weeks and that its officers were making around 100 arrests a day for such offences. There was a 9% rise in recorded incidents compared to a year ago. \"No-one who is experiencing domestic abuse should feel that they have to suffer in silence,\" said senior police office Sue Williams.

       "8  BUENOS AIRES/SANTIAGO/MEXICO CITY/LA PAZ — Lockdowns around Latin America are helping slow the spread of COVID-19, but are having a darker and less-intended consequence: a spike in calls to helplines suggests a rise in domestic abuse, in a region where almost 20 million women and girls suffer sexual and physical violence each year. In cities from Buenos Aires to Mexico City, Santiago, São Paulo and La Paz, families and individuals have been confined in their homes in an unprecedented way, often only allowed out for emergencies or to shop for essentials. Prosecutors, victim support teams, women is movements and the United Nations all say this has caused a rise in domestic violence towards women. They cite increasing numbers of calls to abuse hotlines. In some countries, like Mexico and Brazil, there has been a rise in formal reports of abuse, while in others, including Chile and Bolivia, there has been a drop in formal complaints. Prosecutors and UN Women said the latter was likely not due to a decline in violence, but because women were less able to seek help or report abuse through normal channels. \"The jump in violence has not surprised us, it is the unleashing of a violence that was already there in people,\" said Eva Giberti, founder of the Victims Against Violence program in Argentina, who helps runs a hotline for women to report abuse. \"Under normal social circumstances that had been limited to some degree.\",Argentina is emergency 137 line for abuse victims, supported by the justice department, has seen a 67% rise in calls for help in April versus a year earlier, after a nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 20. UN Women in a report on Wednesday said there was evidence of rising violence against women in Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, and a doubling in the number of femicides in Argentina during the quarantine, citing a women is observatory in Mar del Plata. Pre-pandemic, the Argentine government estimates that a woman was killed every 23 hours.,Domestic violence \"seems to be another pandemic,\" said Lucía Vassallo, a film maker whose documentary \"Line 137\" looks at the issue. 'THEY DARE NOT GO OUT',Rising concern over domestic abuse has been global, with fears victims are being silenced in Italy, calls for help from women rising in Spain, and systems to prevent child abuse in the United States hampered by the lockdown. In Latin America, the fear is that violence against women that was already prevalent is being exacerbated further. The region has seen huge marches and strikes by women over the last year against male aggression and abuse. \"In a situation of confinement, what is happening is that women are locked up with their own abusers in situations where they have very limited outlets,\" Maria Noel Baeza, regional director for UN Women, told Reuters. \"Last year we had 3,800 femicides in the region, how many are we going to have this year?\",In Chile, the women is minister said calls to domestic abuse helplines had increased 70% in the first weekend of quarantine. The government has bolstered counseling channels and looked to keep shelters open for women at risk. Evelyn Matthei, mayor of Santiago is wealthy Providencia district, told Reuters that calls for help to a local office providing legal, psychological and social help had leapt 500% under the lockdown. Formal reports of domestic violence, however, actually declined 40% in the first half of April in Chile, according to the national prosecutors' office, which the UN and prosecutors said was down to women having their movements restricted. \"This probably has to do with the fact that there is violence within the home but that women cannot go out, they dare not go out,\" said Matthei. FEMINIST MANIFESTO,In Brazil is Sao Paulo state, which has been hit hardest by the pandemic and imposed sweeping isolation measures, there was a 45% jump last month in cases of violence against women where police were dispatched, compared to a year earlier, according to thinktank the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. In Mexico, complaints to police of domestic violence rose around a quarter in March against a year earlier, official data show. \"Since the lockdown, there is been an increase in reports of domestic violence, many of those psychological violence,\" said Blanca Aquino, director of the Municipal Institute for Women of Veracruz, the Mexican state with the country is highest rate of femicides. Arussi Unda, from Mexican feminist organization Brujas del Mar, which offers advice to women in abuse cases, said initially many calls to the group had come from neighbors hearing fights in other houses. She said there had been a rise in cases of \"digital violence\" and recently women looking simply to escape. \"Now we get many women asking for advice on how to leave the house and take their children without the partner later wanting to take them away by legal means,\" she said. In Colombia, daily domestic violence calls to a national women is hotline were up nearly 130% during the first 18 days of the country is quarantine, according to government figures. The lockdown has been extended until May 11. Marta Dillon, an Argentine journalist and one of the founders of the \"Ni Una Menos\" women is movement, said women around the world were looking to unite to tackle the issue. \"Male violence has increased under the conditions of quarantine, of social isolation.. Us feminists have been saying this in Italy, in Turkey, in the United States. We are putting together a document amongst ourselves that will be a manifesto.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "9  The Government has moved to reassure victims of domestic violence that services of the State remain available to them. Liz Canavan, Assistant Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach, said the 2km travel restriction did not apply to people trying to escape domestic abuse. At this morning is briefing, Ms Canavan said at a time when people are asked to stay at home, the Government is conscious it may not be a safe place for some people. She added that gardaí have been asked to prioritise suspected instances of domestic abuse, and that other frontline services remain available to potential victims. The Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan launched a campaign this morning to ensure victims are aware of what services are available. From next week new television and radio adverts will be aired, which will reflect the particular issues raised for some by the need to stay at home. Minister Flanagan said: \"This is a really important campaign. At a time when we have all been told to stay at home, I am very conscious that for victims of domestic abuse, home can be anything but a safe place. \"That is why I want victims to know that they will continue to receive the highest priority from the civil and criminal justice system throughout this crisis. I want perpetrators to know that too.\" Meanwhile, the demand for Childline has continued to grow since restrictions were put in place, according to the Director of Services with the ISPCC. Last month the charity reported a surge in calls after schools were closed and restrictions were imposed on gatherings. Speaking on RTÉ is Today with Damien O'Reilly, Caroline O'Sullivan of the ISPCC said the demand has continued to grow, but has now been more focused on the organisation is text and live messaging services. She said this is because children want their conversations to remain private and some children are living in fear of something happening in the home. She said while abuse may not be happening 24 hours a day, some children are living in fear that they or a sibling will say or do something that may lead to an incident. \"The reality is these restrictions which have been put in place for very good reason are exacerbating the abuse scenarios that some children are living in. If you take a child that lives in a domestic violence situation, they are living in that now 24 hours a day.\" Ms O'Sullivan said that the amount of alcohol being drank in homes is leading to an increase similar to that seen around the Christmas period. The Chief Executive of the Children is Rights Alliance said the restrictions are increasing pressure on already vulnerable families and children. Speaking on the same programme, Tanya Ward said that a lot of child safety plans are dependent on children having contact with professionals like teachers, public health nurses and youth workers who can see if something is wrong. She said this has had a knock-on effect on the amount of child protection referrals being made. Ms Ward said a lot of social workers are stilling meeting families, and charities and support organisations are still working with vulnerable people, but not at the same levels. She also said that the restrictions imposed by the Government are leading to an increase in \"toxic stress\" in homes as families approach \"breaking point\". Ms Ward said that they need to look at how to support these families in the future. Meanwhile, a project leader with Barnardos in Cork has said she is really concerned about children living in emergency accommodation during the period of restrictions. Roisin McDaid said parents are reporting children in those situations \"really struggling\" as they are confined to hotel rooms. She said this is having an impact on their ability to access academic work. \"They can not find a quiet space to do that and open a book,\" she said.

       "      <td>The Covid-19 virus is deadly. This is a pandemic and unprecedented measures need to be put in place in order to save human lives. Yet, as we make extraordinary adjustments for the sake of this objective, there is increasing recognition of the ways in which the health-related warlike emergency measures are disproportionately affecting specific sections of our society adversely. Governments have responded to these in various ways, some more proactive and considerate than others, but their overarching message has been: this is the price we have to pay to halt the spread of the virus. While some adverse effects may not have easy solutions, it is still imperative that we identify them. If saving human lives is the overarching objective, it is worth asking ourselves this question: could the lockdown, which is essential, be organised better to minimise or eliminate the loss of lives from the negative consequences of the pandemic management measures? Also, while some adverse effects may not have easy solutions, it is still imperative that we identify them. There are stories about the immense hardships faced by migrant workers, daily wagers, health workers, and people with disabilities. There are accounts of how the new norm of “social distancing” is not being seen for what it is, viz., physical distancing, but is seen as a license for glorifying the demeaning and despicable, not to mention illegal, practice of untouchability towards castes that were stigmatised for doing the most menial jobs nobody else wanted to do. Commentators have made excellent suggestions about how some of these hardships could be alleviated. The central government finally announced a set of measures; whether these are adequate to the enormity of the challenge is a moot point. Coupled with these are racist attacks on people from north-east India because of their similarity with Chinese phenotype. India is not unique in this regard; other countries are experiencing similar negative whiplash on specific sections of their populations. As the spread of the virus gives a fillip to all kinds of discrimination, we need a reality check. Halt the spread of the virus? Of course. But should that translate into stigmatising groups, imposing the burden of adjustment on the most vulnerable? No. In an eminently watchable video on essential hygiene to halt the spread of the coronavirus, an Italian grandma reminds us that the virus has no nationality. One day there will be a vaccine for it, and it will die. The discrimination will endure. There is no vaccine for it. Gendered impacts The one section of the population that is painfully, but sadly not surprisingly, absent from this discussion of negative consequences (whether unintended or foreseen but inevitable) of the anti-pandemic measures has been women. Painfully because the negative consequences of pandemic control measures on women are wide and deep. Unsurprisingly because this is yet another instance of a gender-blind policy that ignores its disproportionate impact on women. The intimate partner violence curve While gender has been absent from the official lens everywhere, the last week has seen a few (although far fewer than warranted) pieces about the impact of pandemic management measures on women. The most horrific and obvious impact of the lockdown imposed to flatten the curve has been a rise in domestic and intimate partner violence (IPV) as has been noted for the US, the UK, and China, among other countries. A rise in domestic violence (DV) literally increases the risk to women’s lives: as one curve gets flattened, the other one slopes upwards, perhaps not exponentially, but sharply, nevertheless. The accounts are painful to read. Women are being battered by frustrated partners and being threatened to be kicked out of the house if they fell sick. A child called a US helpline to report that her mother’s partner had abused her mother and her. With schools and workplaces shut, women and girls in abusive situations have no respite. What, if anything, can be done? One of the big myths about DV and IPV is that it is greater among poorer sections. The reality is that rich and middle-class women are not immune to it. Reaching women in distress needs to be classified as an “essential service.” In India, because this is seen as essentially a problem of the poor, it’s not very high on policy priorities, given the class bias in policymaking. Helplines, shelters and legal assistance for battered women are woefully inadequate at the best of times. It is incredibly hard for women to speak up openly even under the most supportive conditions. With the sudden lockdown, when women find themselves isolated, alone and vulnerable, what are their options? Virtually none. The first step is for administration and law enforcement agencies to recognise the gravity of the problem, to believe women and to sympathise with them. At this time, more than at any other time, women need solid assurance that they will be heard, and that help would be sent if they fear for their or their children’s lives. Reaching women in distress needs to be classified as an “essential service.” The police will have to be told in the strictest terms that they have to believe women, regardless of their class, caste or religion. Given the recent instances of violence by the police, this might seem like a big ask, but the powers-that-be need to insist on the right policy response. Household and care work burden A lockdown increases the burden of household work for all families. Children are off from school. They have to be home-schooled, fed and entertained. The elderly are at risk and have to be attended to with greater care than usual. In India, the daily lives of middle-class families run on the backs of a slew of service providers: maids, drivers, gardeners, dhobi, garbage collectors, small vendors who bring essential goods right to their doorsteps, and neighbourhood provision stores that have an incredibly efficient home delivery service. This whole apparatus is now disrupted, as homes with part-time help are confronted with increased housework because the service providers are in lockdown too. While both men and women are stranded at home, which of the two is dealing with this avalanche of domestic chores and care work disproportionately? In principle, both. In practice, it’s the women, regardless of whether they hold a job (i.e. earn a wage) or not. If they do, then the double burden of domestic chores and their day jobs is now multiplied many times over, because their day job now has a new name: WFH (work from home). For those of us who might be fortunate enough to be in families that share the burden, it is difficult to imagine the catastrophic effect of this sudden and seemingly indefinite rise in work pressure on the mental and physical health of women. This is not imaginary fear-mongering. South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan, has one of the highest ratios, globally, of the times spent on unpaid care work by women relative to men, as the chart shows. The exclusive responsibility of household work or domestic chores on women is one of the key constraints on women’s ability to work outside the home, as my work with Naila Kabeer shows. This crisis has rapidly moved from a health crisis to a full-blown economic recession, as the Indian economy was already tottering when the virus hit. This will mean job losses, with women disproportionately vulnerable to being laid off, making the already declining female labour force participation rate even lower. For those with secure jobs and a regular salary, a temporary lockdown could be a great way to slow down, rejuvenate and pay attention to their creative side. However, creativity requires not being burdened by the monotony of never-ending domestic chores. The Atlantic reminds us that William Shakespeare and Isaac Newton did some of their best work while England was ravaged by the plague, because none of them had childcare responsibilities. Stop the spread, share the burden The question is not “to lockdown or not to lockdown.” The question is: how should we lockdown? The question is not “to lockdown or not to lockdown.” The question is: how should we lockdown? What are the checks and balances that need to be in place? Where should the most vulnerable go if they are distressed? We can take this one step further. If as a result of the lockdown, gender roles within the household revert to the 1950s, flattening the pandemic curve would have flattened all the gains made by women towards equality across the globe. We need to be mindful of how we kill the pandemic, without making women’s equality and mental health collateral damage. As a first step towards that, we need to recognise and highlight the disproportionate gender impacts of the lockdown. While the state machinery can step in relation to IPV, the intra-household sharing of domestic chores is within the private domain. However, women that are valued for their economic contributions outside the home are also more likely to be respected inside the home. Once the lockdown ends, employers need to be especially mindful of not laying off their women employees disproportionately. Overall, policies aimed at ensuring gender equality in labour force participation and in wages will go a long way towards paving the way for gender equality inside homes.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A major campaign across TV, radio and social media aimed at reaching out to victims of domestic abuse has been launched. The campaign - a collaboration between the Government and frontline services - will see adverts across those platforms to reflect the reality of domestic violence amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The campaign seeks to reassure victims of domestic abuse that services for them are still available, and that victims are being prioritised. The ads - which aired on radio today, and television tomorrow - depict the reality for victims of domestic abuse when their home is no longer a safe place. It comes after the Government last week said that the 2km coronavirus travel restriction does not apply to victims of abuse. One of the radio ads depicts a mother trying to reassure her child that their effort to hide from their abuser is just a game of 'Hide and Seek', while the other features a male victim trying to communicate his plight to the emergency services. The TV ad will depict a woman’s attempt to keep in contact with her friend through a video call being interrupted by an abusive partner. Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said it is vital that victims know that services are still there for them, and the law is on their side. \"The very place we have all been sent for safety because of Covid-19 – 'home' - is anything but safe for some people, and these ads recognise that,\" he said. He added: \"I also want to say, unequivocally, to all abusers that the rigors of the law are also istill here'. There is nowhere for perpetrators to hide.\" Women is Aid CEO Sarah Benson said: \"We know at the best of times that the vast majority of domestic violence and abuse do not reach out for services, so now more than ever in these really constrained circumstances, this campaign is an incredibly important initiative.\" While Women is Aid has said calls to its helpline have remained steady at around 500 a week, it did see a spike in contacts following an appearance by Ms Benson and abuse survivor Jessica Bowes on the Late Late Show last Friday night. In particular Ms Benson said they saw a surge in people using their Instant Messaging service. \"Unfortunately if you are stuck in a small space, in an apartment, in a house with somebody of whom you are afraid and who is also monitoring your activities being able to communicate silently can actually be an important way to reach out,\" Ms Benson said. Caitriona Gleeson, Programme and Communications Manager for the umbrella group Safe Ireland, said that the inability of some victims to reach out to support services has been heightened during the pandemic and is contributing to an \"ominous silence\" that many of its members are seeing. \"Ordinarily when a woman is in a controlled relationship or an abusive relationship there will be opportunities for her to get free to make calls, to get to see the services, be it because she is working or because her abusive partner is working, or there are other opportunities to get to the shops or whatever,\" Ms Gleeson said. It is for this reason that Ms Gleeson said this campaign plays an important role in raising awareness in the wider community. \"We want neighbours, friends and colleagues to understand that you have a role to play, where women do not have an opportunity to reach out themselves, you have an opportunity to reach in, you can be her voice.\" Ms Gleeson said. The campaign also highlights that men can be victims of domestic abuse, featuring a story of a male abuse victim and providing the number of the Male Domestic Abuse helpline. Sean Cooke, the CEO of Men is Development Network, said it is \"critical that we make the service known that it is out there and that men can actually make the call and know that they will be listened to and heard and believed as well\". Safe Ireland has called for €1.6 million in funding to enable the sector to manage this crisis adequately. Today the Department of Justice announced it was allocating over €160,00 to community and voluntary groups to support their work and is also funding the making and airing of the ad. However Tusla has also a range of practical supports in place for service providers, including funding temporary replacement staff for those off work due to Covid-19, supplying PPE to those in the sector, providing information and communications technology (ICT) resources to support remote working, and working with service providers to identify accommodation for abuse victims when needed. State Services are also prioritising the issue of domestic abuse during the Covid-19 emergency. The Legal Aid Board has set up a dedicated helpline and is giving priority to domestic abuse cases. The Courts Service is also doing this with every District across the country continuing to have a Court open to hear applications for protection orders and interim and emergency barring orders. On 1 April an Garda Síochána launched 'Operation Faoisimh’, describing it as \"a proactive initiative .. designed to ensure victims of domestic abuse are supported and protected in this extraordinary time\". An Garda Síochána recorded a 16% year-on-year increase in the reporting of domestic abuse incidents between 2019 and 2020, however it said the force had not recorded a significant increase in such incidents since the introduction of Covid-19 public health measures to the start of the month.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We’ve often heard the adage, “Precaution is better than cure”. Now more than ever, as COVID-19 spreads like wildfire, we need to stay indoors. Reducing contact is the only way to control the virus. But social distancing means we’re going against our primal instinct that makes us human – being social. And while social media does help in being connected, it lacks physical affection, comfort and intimacy. In these times of extremes, all of us are feeling some kind of distress, a sign that we need to take care of our mental health. Some of us are lucky to have loving homes, where we can stand by each other. Even as India is now put under lockdown for 21 days, can we assume that each person has a safe space to go back to? Anita Bhatia, Deputy Executive Director of UN Women said, “The very technique we are using to protect people from the virus can perversely impact victims of domestic violence. While we absolutely support the need to follow these measures of social distancing and isolation, we also recognize that it provides an opportunity for abusers to unleash more violence.” India is under lock down to avoid control spread of COVID-19. Image Source: Vox As per World Health Organisation, 1 in 3 women face some form of domestic abuse. This adversely affects their mental and physical health. Moreover, throughout history, women’s bodies have been sites of violence. Societal norms expect women to take care of household duties; since ‘honour’ is linked to their virginity, women’s bodies become more vulnerable. Violence within intimate relationships of LGBTQ+ communities has also witnessed an increase. How then does quarantine and self-isolation affect those who’re caught in abusive situations? Redefining The Concept Of Home Home is often attached with the idea of safe space. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a safe space is “a place intended to be free of bias, conflict, criticism, or potentially threatening actions, ideas, or conversations.” For many, home is where their family lives. It may be a comforting space, but not necessarily a safe space. Comfort can arise out of living with people you’ve always known and loved, or living in a house that you are familiar with. Comfort may also arise out of economic interdependence. However, having comforts does not mean that home is a safe space. Home can also be a regressive place for those who have to hide key parts of their identity. Many a times, people may realise they have irreconcilable differences with their family, and may thus no longer be able to identify it as home. While for some, home may not have a physical manifestation, for others, being home could mean being in a specific house. For women, especially in India, home has always had a different connotation. Women are told from the beginning that they belong to a paraya ghar. This is a way of distancing them from their own homes, since they are supposed to go and live with their husbands’ family after marriage. However, even in their husbands’ homes, women may be treated as outsiders. Where then is the home of a woman – with their parents or their husbands? Home, as in popular imagination, could very well be an abusive space for some people. Since women are supposed to hold a passive role in society, they are often the ones who find themselves stuck in situations of abuse. And since women are usually dependent on their husbands or their family for financial support, it is difficult for them to escape these situations. Added to this is the judgement of society that deters them from leaving abusive situations. Not matter through what lens you look at domestic abuse, women often tend to suffer more because of societal censure, lack of financial independence, and no place to escape to. This is not to say that men are not victims of domestic abuse. This is only to point out that patriarchy allows cis-gendered straight men to have more power than women and other non-binary genders when it comes to the domestic sphere. Whatever the sex, gender, or sexual orientation of a person be, it is quite difficult for those suffering from domestic abuse to escape violence. Governments are enforcing their citizens to stay back at home. So in a scenario where people are forced inside with their abusers in order to contain the spread of COVID 19, what would ‘home’ mean to them?

This means that all our relationships revolve around who has power/ who is supposed to have power. Since COVID-19, people are experiencing a lack of control. Due to quarantine and lockdown, all need for control is bound to get translated into domestic lives. Because of how patriarchy works, it is most likely that household chores will not be equally performed by family members. And since we are all strongly advised to stay home, this could mean that women’s household burdens would only increase, further being monitored by family members. Quarantine measures could also mean an increase in physical and verbal violence for those who’ve somehow found themselves in abusive situations. Survivors could end up being forced inside with their abusers, with no hope of immediate escape. Hotline numbers that address domestic violence are suggesting that women are unwilling or unable to seek medical assistance after suffering physical violence. They are also worried about contracting COVID-19 if they visit hospitals. Since hospitals are also already overburdened, it is also possible that they do not have the capacity to extend medical help. Some survivors are also unwilling to go back to their parents’ house because they fear unknowingly infecting them with the virus. Some are being abused by their partners for simply coughing. The survivors are warned that they would suffer dire consequences if they spread COVID-19 to their partners. They also fear being locked out of their houses. It is possible that at this point, places of refuge like women’s shelters would perhaps be overburdened as well. While quarantine may not necessarily create new situations of harm, it can lead to an increase in violence in abusive households. Keeping in mind all such scenarios, Deputy Executive Director of UN has called for governments to announce provisions for paid sick leave for women, and care packages for unpaid care work. It is financial independence from abusers that can give some form of security to survivors. The Situation In India As per the UN Women, lifetime physical and/or Sexual Intimate Violence in India stand at a staggering 288%. India ranks 125 on Gender Inequality Index and 87 on the Global Gender Gap. This indicates that women have much less access to resources than their male counterparts, especially in economic, political, education and health sectors. Due to this lack, most women would be forced to stay with their abusive partners throughout their lives, without reporting it. As already pointed out, girls and women in India over and over that they belong to someone else’s home. Since upbringing is gendered, girls are often pushed into learning skills like cooking, cleaning, stitching and other household chores, while boys are sent out to school to study. This is clear from the fact that India’s average in young women’s literacy is still 20 percentage points behind the world average. All of this means that girls and women tend to be more vulnerable and susceptible to domestic violence in India.

While we go under lockdown, it is important to extend our support to people who find themselves in abusive homes. The first and foremost thing you can do is listen and believe what victims are going through when they tell you. It is important for them to have someone they can trust. By listening, you can provide them a mental safe space, where they can express their own feelings, both in relation to being shut inside, and what they are suffering as a consequence. If possible, you can help them out with resources – by sharing simple things like groceries, or sending across some food, you can help ease out their mental stress a little. In case you hear sounds of violence, you can possibly ring the bell or knock on the door. This would be an indication to the abuser that the neighbours are aware of what is going on inside the house and won’t simply stand by in silence. Since both abusers and victims wish to keep such forms of violence under wraps, it is a good idea to indicate your presence. This can serve as a deterrent to the abuser and as support for the victim. Finally, it is of utmost importance to seek professional help. If the situation seems extremely dire, do no intervene. It can further put the victim in danger. Instead call 1091 for help.

While we self-isolate in order to stop COVID-19 from spreading, let us keep all those not as privileged as us in mind. It could really save a life.</td>\n",

       "      <td>“For 75 years, CARE has always prioritized the needs of the world’s most vulnerable,” says Michelle Nunn, president and CEO of CARE USA. “From natural disasters and armed conflict to public health emergencies, our past Rapid Gender Analyses have shown that power discrepancies are often exacerbated during emergencies, which deepens existing vulnerabilities. We need to ensure that the emergency response to COVID-19 doesn’t forget society’s most marginalized people, as is too often the case. This COVID-19 Global Rapid Gender Analysis shows us how.” The Rapid Gender Analysis for COVID-19 examines evidence from past public health emergencies, as well as available data around how COVID-19 affects gender roles and responsibilities; access to health care, including sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR); gender-based violence (GBV); decision-making and leadership; and access to information. The Rapid Gender Analysis for COVID-19 continues by calling for: Systematic and systemic collection and use of sex and age disaggregated data (with additional disaggregation based on at-risk groups, including those who are pregnant) and gender indicators to be included in all assessments for effective program and advocacy. Conducting recurring analyses of local social and gender norms and customs that define health-seeking behaviours and their related barriers. Meaningful engagement of women, adolescent girls and all marginalized groups in leadership and decision-making roles in preparedness and response efforts, at all levels—from global to local. Recognize the capacities of women, men, adolescent boys and girls through social networks, women’s groups and civil society. Provide gender-sensitive support to frontline health workers to meet health and psychosocial needs, including for survivors of gender-based violence. Continue the provision of life-saving health services, including SRHR services, specifically the MISP and GBV prevention and response, as well as training first responders on how to handle GBV disclosures. Address stigma, xenophobia and other power dynamics that could hinder access to life-saving health/SRHR for marginalized groups, including shelter and safe spaces for self-isolation and care. Establish and/or strengthen inclusive community engagement and accountability mechanisms. Plan for an increase in GBV cases, and/or an increase in vulnerability and needs of GBV survivors, and strengthen and fill gaps in the provision of local GBV survivor-centered referral systems and services. Ensure responses take a rights-based approach, assuring and respecting the rights of refugees, internally displaced populations, migrant/domestic workers, and other people of concern. “The effects and impact of global crises, such as COVID-19, differ greatly across the gender spectrum,” said Kristin Kim Bart, Senior Director of Gender Equality for the International Rescue Committee. “While the specific impacts and needs of women and girls have been profiled more in the media in recent weeks than during previous times of crisis, we need to see this translate into different decisions and action. Decision makers cannot ignore these differences when putting forward response plans and ensure women and girls’ voices inform all levels of the response. It is critical that changes are made now in collecting and analyzing data, enacting governmental policies, and allocating resources so that women and girls are not left further behind.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>WINNIPEG – OPINION – Julie Racette, a Winnipeg resident from Ebb and Flow First Nation, died early April 11 after being taken to hospital. Initially, the cause of death of the 34-year-old was believed to be a medical problem. After an autopsy, police said she had been a victim of homicide and her husband, Wayne Melnychuk, 42, was charged with manslaughter. Melnychuk disappeared a day after Racette died. He is described as 5-7 with a medium build, brown hair, and is Caucasian in appearance. Police warn the public not to approach him and call 911 if they see him. Racette and Melnychuk were a couple for 14 years and have three children, aged 2, 11, and 14. Chasity Almas, Racette’s oldest sister, said the couple had been arguing more than usual due to “being locked down with the kids” during the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in an “escalation” in tension because “they were getting on each other’s nerves,” she said. Domestic violence has been rising from day one of the COVID-19 pandemic. In China’s Hubei province — where the virus began — domestic violence reports tripled after the lockdown was instituted. In France, domestic abuse has risen 36 percent and, in Brazil, it’s up 40 percent. In the United Kingdom, there’s been a 25 percent increase. In Vancouver, calls to domestic violence shelters have tripled. In York, just north of Toronto, such complaints have risen 22 percent. We have learned the recent mass killings in Nova Scotia began with a domestic assault. While most crime is decreasing because people are at home, domestic abuse is going up. It’s already alarmingly high. Domestic violence is consistently the top issue Winnipeg police respond to. Every year, these represent around 16,00 calls, or 44 each day. It’s too early in the pandemic to judge Winnipeg police statistics (a spokesman said there is “not a statistically significant change in domestic violence calls”) but domestic violence prompted a 911 call to police on April 9. Officers who responded to the call from a home on Anderson Avenue shot 36-year old Jason Collins. The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba is looking into the incident. On March 24, Winnipeg police responded to a call that a two-year-old had been injured in his home. Brett White died two days later in hospital. Police charged his stepmother, Victoria Thiessen, with manslaughter. A Manitoba Crown attorney told me this week that the amount of domestic violence cases he has seen during the pandemic is “unprecedented.” Many are first-time charges against individuals with no record of domestic abuse. Trauma, substance abuse, and stress brought on by the pandemic — aggravated by the order to stay home — have created a perfect situation for domestic violence to thrive. If partners — most often women with children — leave, they are at the mercy of shelters and agencies whose funding and resources have been reduced. While the Manitoba Association of Women’s Shelters has been able to keep all 10 provincially funded women’s shelters open alongside 10 other affiliated partners, critical spaces such as the North Point Douglas Women’s Centre have had to reduce hours, staffing, and access to resources such as computers and food banks. Overall, it appears Indigenous women and families are some of the hardest hit and deserve unique attention. A report by the Manitoba First Nations Police Service, which polices six First Nations, for the weekend of April 10 to 13, shows half of the cases officers responded to were domestic disputes. Help is coming. On April 4, the federal government announced $40 million for women’s shelters and $10 million for Indigenous family shelters. Still, concerns about social distancing, moving, and safety have resulted in women’s shelters reporting reduced calls and fewer families in shelters, the Manitoba association said. In other words, the abuse is still there, but it’s riskier than ever for abused spouses to leave home. Child welfare agencies have logged fewer reports of child abuse, but this is likely due to fewer witness accounts because school staff make up to 90 percent of all reports of child abuse — and school is out. This means the public is at the front line of domestic violence and child abuse. During this pandemic, we must also work to stop an epidemic of domestic violence. If you see, hear, or know of abuse, report it. The 24-hour domestic violence helpline is 1-877-977-007. The phone number for the Kids Help Phone is 1-800-668-6868.

       "0  The Covid-19 virus is deadly. This is a pandemic and unprecedented measures need to be put in place in order to save human lives. Yet, as we make extraordinary adjustments for the sake of this objective, there is increasing recognition of the ways in which the health-related warlike emergency measures are disproportionately affecting specific sections of our society adversely. Governments have responded to these in various ways, some more proactive and considerate than others, but their overarching message has been: this is the price we have to pay to halt the spread of the virus. While some adverse effects may not have easy solutions, it is still imperative that we identify them. If saving human lives is the overarching objective, it is worth asking ourselves this question: could the lockdown, which is essential, be organised better to minimise or eliminate the loss of lives from the negative consequences of the pandemic management measures? Also, while some adverse effects may not have easy solutions, it is still imperative that we identify them. There are stories about the immense hardships faced by migrant workers, daily wagers, health workers, and people with disabilities. There are accounts of how the new norm of “social distancing” is not being seen for what it is, viz., physical distancing, but is seen as a license for glorifying the demeaning and despicable, not to mention illegal, practice of untouchability towards castes that were stigmatised for doing the most menial jobs nobody else wanted to do. Commentators have made excellent suggestions about how some of these hardships could be alleviated. The central government finally announced a set of measures; whether these are adequate to the enormity of the challenge is a moot point. Coupled with these are racist attacks on people from north-east India because of their similarity with Chinese phenotype. India is not unique in this regard; other countries are experiencing similar negative whiplash on specific sections of their populations. As the spread of the virus gives a fillip to all kinds of discrimination, we need a reality check. Halt the spread of the virus? Of course. But should that translate into stigmatising groups, imposing the burden of adjustment on the most vulnerable? No. In an eminently watchable video on essential hygiene to halt the spread of the coronavirus, an Italian grandma reminds us that the virus has no nationality. One day there will be a vaccine for it, and it will die. The discrimination will endure. There is no vaccine for it. Gendered impacts The one section of the population that is painfully, but sadly not surprisingly, absent from this discussion of negative consequences (whether unintended or foreseen but inevitable) of the anti-pandemic measures has been women. Painfully because the negative consequences of pandemic control measures on women are wide and deep. Unsurprisingly because this is yet another instance of a gender-blind policy that ignores its disproportionate impact on women. The intimate partner violence curve While gender has been absent from the official lens everywhere, the last week has seen a few (although far fewer than warranted) pieces about the impact of pandemic management measures on women. The most horrific and obvious impact of the lockdown imposed to flatten the curve has been a rise in domestic and intimate partner violence (IPV) as has been noted for the US, the UK, and China, among other countries. A rise in domestic violence (DV) literally increases the risk to women’s lives: as one curve gets flattened, the other one slopes upwards, perhaps not exponentially, but sharply, nevertheless. The accounts are painful to read. Women are being battered by frustrated partners and being threatened to be kicked out of the house if they fell sick. A child called a US helpline to report that her mother’s partner had abused her mother and her. With schools and workplaces shut, women and girls in abusive situations have no respite. What, if anything, can be done? One of the big myths about DV and IPV is that it is greater among poorer sections. The reality is that rich and middle-class women are not immune to it. Reaching women in distress needs to be classified as an “essential service.” In India, because this is seen as essentially a problem of the poor, it’s not very high on policy priorities, given the class bias in policymaking. Helplines, shelters and legal assistance for battered women are woefully inadequate at the best of times. It is incredibly hard for women to speak up openly even under the most supportive conditions. With the sudden lockdown, when women find themselves isolated, alone and vulnerable, what are their options? Virtually none. The first step is for administration and law enforcement agencies to recognise the gravity of the problem, to believe women and to sympathise with them. At this time, more than at any other time, women need solid assurance that they will be heard, and that help would be sent if they fear for their or their children’s lives. Reaching women in distress needs to be classified as an “essential service.” The police will have to be told in the strictest terms that they have to believe women, regardless of their class, caste or religion. Given the recent instances of violence by the police, this might seem like a big ask, but the powers-that-be need to insist on the right policy response. Household and care work burden A lockdown increases the burden of household work for all families. Children are off from school. They have to be home-schooled, fed and entertained. The elderly are at risk and have to be attended to with greater care than usual. In India, the daily lives of middle-class families run on the backs of a slew of service providers: maids, drivers, gardeners, dhobi, garbage collectors, small vendors who bring essential goods right to their doorsteps, and neighbourhood provision stores that have an incredibly efficient home delivery service. This whole apparatus is now disrupted, as homes with part-time help are confronted with increased housework because the service providers are in lockdown too. While both men and women are stranded at home, which of the two is dealing with this avalanche of domestic chores and care work disproportionately? In principle, both. In practice, it’s the women, regardless of whether they hold a job (i.e. earn a wage) or not. If they do, then the double burden of domestic chores and their day jobs is now multiplied many times over, because their day job now has a new name: WFH (work from home). For those of us who might be fortunate enough to be in families that share the burden, it is difficult to imagine the catastrophic effect of this sudden and seemingly indefinite rise in work pressure on the mental and physical health of women. This is not imaginary fear-mongering. South Asia, particularly India and Pakistan, has one of the highest ratios, globally, of the times spent on unpaid care work by women relative to men, as the chart shows. The exclusive responsibility of household work or domestic chores on women is one of the key constraints on women’s ability to work outside the home, as my work with Naila Kabeer shows. This crisis has rapidly moved from a health crisis to a full-blown economic recession, as the Indian economy was already tottering when the virus hit. This will mean job losses, with women disproportionately vulnerable to being laid off, making the already declining female labour force participation rate even lower. For those with secure jobs and a regular salary, a temporary lockdown could be a great way to slow down, rejuvenate and pay attention to their creative side. However, creativity requires not being burdened by the monotony of never-ending domestic chores. The Atlantic reminds us that William Shakespeare and Isaac Newton did some of their best work while England was ravaged by the plague, because none of them had childcare responsibilities. Stop the spread, share the burden The question is not “to lockdown or not to lockdown.” The question is: how should we lockdown? The question is not “to lockdown or not to lockdown.” The question is: how should we lockdown? What are the checks and balances that need to be in place? Where should the most vulnerable go if they are distressed? We can take this one step further. If as a result of the lockdown, gender roles within the household revert to the 1950s, flattening the pandemic curve would have flattened all the gains made by women towards equality across the globe. We need to be mindful of how we kill the pandemic, without making women’s equality and mental health collateral damage. As a first step towards that, we need to recognise and highlight the disproportionate gender impacts of the lockdown. While the state machinery can step in relation to IPV, the intra-household sharing of domestic chores is within the private domain. However, women that are valued for their economic contributions outside the home are also more likely to be respected inside the home. Once the lockdown ends, employers need to be especially mindful of not laying off their women employees disproportionately. Overall, policies aimed at ensuring gender equality in labour force participation and in wages will go a long way towards paving the way for gender equality inside homes.  \n",
       "1  A major campaign across TV, radio and social media aimed at reaching out to victims of domestic abuse has been launched. The campaign - a collaboration between the Government and frontline services - will see adverts across those platforms to reflect the reality of domestic violence amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The campaign seeks to reassure victims of domestic abuse that services for them are still available, and that victims are being prioritised. The ads - which aired on radio today, and television tomorrow - depict the reality for victims of domestic abuse when their home is no longer a safe place. It comes after the Government last week said that the 2km coronavirus travel restriction does not apply to victims of abuse. One of the radio ads depicts a mother trying to reassure her child that their effort to hide from their abuser is just a game of 'Hide and Seek', while the other features a male victim trying to communicate his plight to the emergency services. The TV ad will depict a woman’s attempt to keep in contact with her friend through a video call being interrupted by an abusive partner. Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said it is vital that victims know that services are still there for them, and the law is on their side. \"The very place we have all been sent for safety because of Covid-19 – 'home' - is anything but safe for some people, and these ads recognise that,\" he said. He added: \"I also want to say, unequivocally, to all abusers that the rigors of the law are also istill here'. There is nowhere for perpetrators to hide.\" Women is Aid CEO Sarah Benson said: \"We know at the best of times that the vast majority of domestic violence and abuse do not reach out for services, so now more than ever in these really constrained circumstances, this campaign is an incredibly important initiative.\" While Women is Aid has said calls to its helpline have remained steady at around 500 a week, it did see a spike in contacts following an appearance by Ms Benson and abuse survivor Jessica Bowes on the Late Late Show last Friday night. In particular Ms Benson said they saw a surge in people using their Instant Messaging service. \"Unfortunately if you are stuck in a small space, in an apartment, in a house with somebody of whom you are afraid and who is also monitoring your activities being able to communicate silently can actually be an important way to reach out,\" Ms Benson said. Caitriona Gleeson, Programme and Communications Manager for the umbrella group Safe Ireland, said that the inability of some victims to reach out to support services has been heightened during the pandemic and is contributing to an \"ominous silence\" that many of its members are seeing. \"Ordinarily when a woman is in a controlled relationship or an abusive relationship there will be opportunities for her to get free to make calls, to get to see the services, be it because she is working or because her abusive partner is working, or there are other opportunities to get to the shops or whatever,\" Ms Gleeson said. It is for this reason that Ms Gleeson said this campaign plays an important role in raising awareness in the wider community. \"We want neighbours, friends and colleagues to understand that you have a role to play, where women do not have an opportunity to reach out themselves, you have an opportunity to reach in, you can be her voice.\" Ms Gleeson said. The campaign also highlights that men can be victims of domestic abuse, featuring a story of a male abuse victim and providing the number of the Male Domestic Abuse helpline. Sean Cooke, the CEO of Men is Development Network, said it is \"critical that we make the service known that it is out there and that men can actually make the call and know that they will be listened to and heard and believed as well\". Safe Ireland has called for €1.6 million in funding to enable the sector to manage this crisis adequately. Today the Department of Justice announced it was allocating over €160,00 to community and voluntary groups to support their work and is also funding the making and airing of the ad. However Tusla has also a range of practical supports in place for service providers, including funding temporary replacement staff for those off work due to Covid-19, supplying PPE to those in the sector, providing information and communications technology (ICT) resources to support remote working, and working with service providers to identify accommodation for abuse victims when needed. State Services are also prioritising the issue of domestic abuse during the Covid-19 emergency. The Legal Aid Board has set up a dedicated helpline and is giving priority to domestic abuse cases. The Courts Service is also doing this with every District across the country continuing to have a Court open to hear applications for protection orders and interim and emergency barring orders. On 1 April an Garda Síochána launched 'Operation Faoisimh’, describing it as \"a proactive initiative .. designed to ensure victims of domestic abuse are supported and protected in this extraordinary time\". An Garda Síochána recorded a 16% year-on-year increase in the reporting of domestic abuse incidents between 2019 and 2020, however it said the force had not recorded a significant increase in such incidents since the introduction of Covid-19 public health measures to the start of the month.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "2  We’ve often heard the adage, “Precaution is better than cure”. Now more than ever, as COVID-19 spreads like wildfire, we need to stay indoors. Reducing contact is the only way to control the virus. But social distancing means we’re going against our primal instinct that makes us human – being social. And while social media does help in being connected, it lacks physical affection, comfort and intimacy. In these times of extremes, all of us are feeling some kind of distress, a sign that we need to take care of our mental health. Some of us are lucky to have loving homes, where we can stand by each other. Even as India is now put under lockdown for 21 days, can we assume that each person has a safe space to go back to? Anita Bhatia, Deputy Executive Director of UN Women said, “The very technique we are using to protect people from the virus can perversely impact victims of domestic violence. While we absolutely support the need to follow these measures of social distancing and isolation, we also recognize that it provides an opportunity for abusers to unleash more violence.” India is under lock down to avoid control spread of COVID-19. Image Source: Vox As per World Health Organisation, 1 in 3 women face some form of domestic abuse. This adversely affects their mental and physical health. Moreover, throughout history, women’s bodies have been sites of violence. Societal norms expect women to take care of household duties; since ‘honour’ is linked to their virginity, women’s bodies become more vulnerable. Violence within intimate relationships of LGBTQ+ communities has also witnessed an increase. How then does quarantine and self-isolation affect those who’re caught in abusive situations? Redefining The Concept Of Home Home is often attached with the idea of safe space. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a safe space is “a place intended to be free of bias, conflict, criticism, or potentially threatening actions, ideas, or conversations.” For many, home is where their family lives. It may be a comforting space, but not necessarily a safe space. Comfort can arise out of living with people you’ve always known and loved, or living in a house that you are familiar with. Comfort may also arise out of economic interdependence. However, having comforts does not mean that home is a safe space. Home can also be a regressive place for those who have to hide key parts of their identity. Many a times, people may realise they have irreconcilable differences with their family, and may thus no longer be able to identify it as home. While for some, home may not have a physical manifestation, for others, being home could mean being in a specific house. For women, especially in India, home has always had a different connotation. Women are told from the beginning that they belong to a paraya ghar. This is a way of distancing them from their own homes, since they are supposed to go and live with their husbands’ family after marriage. However, even in their husbands’ homes, women may be treated as outsiders. Where then is the home of a woman – with their parents or their husbands? Home, as in popular imagination, could very well be an abusive space for some people. Since women are supposed to hold a passive role in society, they are often the ones who find themselves stuck in situations of abuse. And since women are usually dependent on their husbands or their family for financial support, it is difficult for them to escape these situations. Added to this is the judgement of society that deters them from leaving abusive situations. Not matter through what lens you look at domestic abuse, women often tend to suffer more because of societal censure, lack of financial independence, and no place to escape to. This is not to say that men are not victims of domestic abuse. This is only to point out that patriarchy allows cis-gendered straight men to have more power than women and other non-binary genders when it comes to the domestic sphere. Whatever the sex, gender, or sexual orientation of a person be, it is quite difficult for those suffering from domestic abuse to escape violence. Governments are enforcing their citizens to stay back at home. So in a scenario where people are forced inside with their abusers in order to contain the spread of COVID 19, what would ‘home’ mean to them? Also read: COVID-19: Can A Health Crisis Become A Breeding Site For Gender Inequality? COVID 19 And Domestic Abuse All social relations are a nexus of power. This means that all our relationships revolve around who has power/ who is supposed to have power. Since COVID-19, people are experiencing a lack of control. Due to quarantine and lockdown, all need for control is bound to get translated into domestic lives. Because of how patriarchy works, it is most likely that household chores will not be equally performed by family members. And since we are all strongly advised to stay home, this could mean that women’s household burdens would only increase, further being monitored by family members. Quarantine measures could also mean an increase in physical and verbal violence for those who’ve somehow found themselves in abusive situations. Survivors could end up being forced inside with their abusers, with no hope of immediate escape. Hotline numbers that address domestic violence are suggesting that women are unwilling or unable to seek medical assistance after suffering physical violence. They are also worried about contracting COVID-19 if they visit hospitals. Since hospitals are also already overburdened, it is also possible that they do not have the capacity to extend medical help. Some survivors are also unwilling to go back to their parents’ house because they fear unknowingly infecting them with the virus. Some are being abused by their partners for simply coughing. The survivors are warned that they would suffer dire consequences if they spread COVID-19 to their partners. They also fear being locked out of their houses. It is possible that at this point, places of refuge like women’s shelters would perhaps be overburdened as well. While quarantine may not necessarily create new situations of harm, it can lead to an increase in violence in abusive households. Keeping in mind all such scenarios, Deputy Executive Director of UN has called for governments to announce provisions for paid sick leave for women, and care packages for unpaid care work. It is financial independence from abusers that can give some form of security to survivors. The Situation In India As per the UN Women, lifetime physical and/or Sexual Intimate Violence in India stand at a staggering 288%. India ranks 125 on Gender Inequality Index and 87 on the Global Gender Gap. This indicates that women have much less access to resources than their male counterparts, especially in economic, political, education and health sectors. Due to this lack, most women would be forced to stay with their abusive partners throughout their lives, without reporting it. As already pointed out, girls and women in India over and over that they belong to someone else’s home. Since upbringing is gendered, girls are often pushed into learning skills like cooking, cleaning, stitching and other household chores, while boys are sent out to school to study. This is clear from the fact that India’s average in young women’s literacy is still 20 percentage points behind the world average. All of this means that girls and women tend to be more vulnerable and susceptible to domestic violence in India.

While we go under lockdown, it is important to extend our support to people who find themselves in abusive homes. The first and foremost thing you can do is listen and believe what victims are going through when they tell you. It is important for them to have someone they can trust. By listening, you can provide them a mental safe space, where they can express their own feelings, both in relation to being shut inside, and what they are suffering as a consequence. If possible, you can help them out with resources – by sharing simple things like groceries, or sending across some food, you can help ease out their mental stress a little. In case you hear sounds of violence, you can possibly ring the bell or knock on the door. This would be an indication to the abuser that the neighbours are aware of what is going on inside the house and won’t simply stand by in silence. Since both abusers and victims wish to keep such forms of violence under wraps, it is a good idea to indicate your presence. This can serve as a deterrent to the abuser and as support for the victim. Finally, it is of utmost importance to seek professional help. If the situation seems extremely dire, do no intervene. It can further put the victim in danger. Instead call 1091 for help. Other Domestic violence helpline numbers can be found at India Helpline, Naree, and standupagainstviolence.org. While we self-isolate in order to stop COVID-19 from spreading, let us keep all those not as privileged as us in mind. It could really save a life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "3  “For 75 years, CARE has always prioritized the needs of the world’s most vulnerable,” says Michelle Nunn, president and CEO of CARE USA. “From natural disasters and armed conflict to public health emergencies, our past Rapid Gender Analyses have shown that power discrepancies are often exacerbated during emergencies, which deepens existing vulnerabilities. We need to ensure that the emergency response to COVID-19 doesn’t forget society’s most marginalized people, as is too often the case. This COVID-19 Global Rapid Gender Analysis shows us how.” The Rapid Gender Analysis for COVID-19 examines evidence from past public health emergencies, as well as available data around how COVID-19 affects gender roles and responsibilities; access to health care, including sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR); gender-based violence (GBV); decision-making and leadership; and access to information. The Rapid Gender Analysis for COVID-19 continues by calling for: Systematic and systemic collection and use of sex and age disaggregated data (with additional disaggregation based on at-risk groups, including those who are pregnant) and gender indicators to be included in all assessments for effective program and advocacy. Conducting recurring analyses of local social and gender norms and customs that define health-seeking behaviours and their related barriers. Meaningful engagement of women, adolescent girls and all marginalized groups in leadership and decision-making roles in preparedness and response efforts, at all levels—from global to local. Recognize the capacities of women, men, adolescent boys and girls through social networks, women’s groups and civil society. Provide gender-sensitive support to frontline health workers to meet health and psychosocial needs, including for survivors of gender-based violence. Continue the provision of life-saving health services, including SRHR services, specifically the MISP and GBV prevention and response, as well as training first responders on how to handle GBV disclosures. Address stigma, xenophobia and other power dynamics that could hinder access to life-saving health/SRHR for marginalized groups, including shelter and safe spaces for self-isolation and care. Establish and/or strengthen inclusive community engagement and accountability mechanisms. Plan for an increase in GBV cases, and/or an increase in vulnerability and needs of GBV survivors, and strengthen and fill gaps in the provision of local GBV survivor-centered referral systems and services. Ensure responses take a rights-based approach, assuring and respecting the rights of refugees, internally displaced populations, migrant/domestic workers, and other people of concern. “The effects and impact of global crises, such as COVID-19, differ greatly across the gender spectrum,” said Kristin Kim Bart, Senior Director of Gender Equality for the International Rescue Committee. “While the specific impacts and needs of women and girls have been profiled more in the media in recent weeks than during previous times of crisis, we need to see this translate into different decisions and action. Decision makers cannot ignore these differences when putting forward response plans and ensure women and girls’ voices inform all levels of the response. It is critical that changes are made now in collecting and analyzing data, enacting governmental policies, and allocating resources so that women and girls are not left further behind.”

       "4  WINNIPEG – OPINION – Julie Racette, a Winnipeg resident from Ebb and Flow First Nation, died early April 11 after being taken to hospital. Initially, the cause of death of the 34-year-old was believed to be a medical problem. After an autopsy, police said she had been a victim of homicide and her husband, Wayne Melnychuk, 42, was charged with manslaughter. Melnychuk disappeared a day after Racette died. He is described as 5-7 with a medium build, brown hair, and is Caucasian in appearance. Police warn the public not to approach him and call 911 if they see him. Racette and Melnychuk were a couple for 14 years and have three children, aged 2, 11, and 14. Chasity Almas, Racette’s oldest sister, said the couple had been arguing more than usual due to “being locked down with the kids” during the COVID-19 pandemic. This resulted in an “escalation” in tension because “they were getting on each other’s nerves,” she said. Domestic violence has been rising from day one of the COVID-19 pandemic. In China’s Hubei province — where the virus began — domestic violence reports tripled after the lockdown was instituted. In France, domestic abuse has risen 36 percent and, in Brazil, it’s up 40 percent. In the United Kingdom, there’s been a 25 percent increase. In Vancouver, calls to domestic violence shelters have tripled. In York, just north of Toronto, such complaints have risen 22 percent. We have learned the recent mass killings in Nova Scotia began with a domestic assault. While most crime is decreasing because people are at home, domestic abuse is going up. It’s already alarmingly high. Domestic violence is consistently the top issue Winnipeg police respond to. Every year, these represent around 16,00 calls, or 44 each day. It’s too early in the pandemic to judge Winnipeg police statistics (a spokesman said there is “not a statistically significant change in domestic violence calls”) but domestic violence prompted a 911 call to police on April 9. Officers who responded to the call from a home on Anderson Avenue shot 36-year old Jason Collins. The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba is looking into the incident. On March 24, Winnipeg police responded to a call that a two-year-old had been injured in his home. Brett White died two days later in hospital. Police charged his stepmother, Victoria Thiessen, with manslaughter. A Manitoba Crown attorney told me this week that the amount of domestic violence cases he has seen during the pandemic is “unprecedented.” Many are first-time charges against individuals with no record of domestic abuse. Trauma, substance abuse, and stress brought on by the pandemic — aggravated by the order to stay home — have created a perfect situation for domestic violence to thrive. If partners — most often women with children — leave, they are at the mercy of shelters and agencies whose funding and resources have been reduced. While the Manitoba Association of Women’s Shelters has been able to keep all 10 provincially funded women’s shelters open alongside 10 other affiliated partners, critical spaces such as the North Point Douglas Women’s Centre have had to reduce hours, staffing, and access to resources such as computers and food banks. Overall, it appears Indigenous women and families are some of the hardest hit and deserve unique attention. A report by the Manitoba First Nations Police Service, which polices six First Nations, for the weekend of April 10 to 13, shows half of the cases officers responded to were domestic disputes. Help is coming. On April 4, the federal government announced $40 million for women’s shelters and $10 million for Indigenous family shelters. Still, concerns about social distancing, moving, and safety have resulted in women’s shelters reporting reduced calls and fewer families in shelters, the Manitoba association said. In other words, the abuse is still there, but it’s riskier than ever for abused spouses to leave home. Child welfare agencies have logged fewer reports of child abuse, but this is likely due to fewer witness accounts because school staff make up to 90 percent of all reports of child abuse — and school is out. This means the public is at the front line of domestic violence and child abuse. During this pandemic, we must also work to stop an epidemic of domestic violence. If you see, hear, or know of abuse, report it. The 24-hour domestic violence helpline is 1-877-977-007. The phone number for the Kids Help Phone is 1-800-668-6868.
